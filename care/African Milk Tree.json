    "name": "African Milk Tree",
    "climate": ["The African Milk Tree thrives in warm and arid climates often found in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "It prefers temperatures that do not drop below 50°F, making it unsuitable for cold climates.", "High humidity levels are not necessary; this plant is drought resistant.", "It can adapt to indoor climates if kept in warm and bright areas."],
    "sunlight": ["Requires bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth indoors.", "Can tolerate some direct sunlight, though too much may cause leaf burn.", "If kept outdoors, it should be shielded from intense, direct afternoon sun.", "Grow lights can supplement its sunlight needs when indoors during winter."],
    "watering": ["Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.", "Overwatering can lead to root rot; ensure proper drainage.", "During the winter, reduce watering as the plant requires less moisture.", "Use tepid water to prevent shock from cold water harming the roots."],
    "soil": ["Plant in well-draining cactus or succulent mix to prevent waterlogging.", "A mixture with sand, perlite, and peat works well to provide proper aeration.", "The soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral for optimal health.", "Avoid heavy soils that retain moisture, as they can cause root issues."],
    "toxic": ["The sap of the African Milk Tree is toxic and can cause irritation.", "Contact with the skin can lead to rashes; wear gloves when handling."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season.", "Pruning can help maintain shape and encourage bushier growth.", "Repot every 2-3 years to refresh the soil and allow room for growth.", "Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent water accumulation."]
