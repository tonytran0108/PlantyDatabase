    "name": "Agapanthus",
    "climate": [
        "Agapanthus thrives in Mediterranean climates with mild wet winters and dry summers.",
        "It grows well in temperate zones where temperatures are moderate year-round.",
        "In subtropical climates, they flourish with the warm, humid conditions prevailing.",
        "They can also adapt to oceanic climates where there is ample rainfall and mild temperatures."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Agapanthus prefers full sunlight for the better part of the day to thrive optimally.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but may exhibit reduced flowering performance.",
        "In excessively hot climates, some afternoon shade can prevent sunburn on leaves.",
        "It's crucial they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight to bloom properly."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Agapanthus requires regular watering, especially during its growing season in spring and summer.",
        "It's essential to maintain moist soil but avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.",
        "During the dormant winter period, reduce the frequency of watering significantly.",
        "Ensure the soil has good drainage to help prevent standing water around the plant roots."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining soil with lots of organic matter to enhance its growth.",
        "It's tolerant of various soil types, as long as the drainage is sufficient to prevent root rot.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH soils are ideal, as they support nutrient availability.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain too much moisture and can lead to root problems."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "All parts of the Agapanthus plant are toxic if ingested by pets or humans.",
        "They contain saponins, which can cause mild irritation to severe gastrointestinal distress."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadheading spent flowers encourages more blooms and a longer flowering season.",
        "Apply a high-potassium fertilizer during the growing season to promote strong flowering."
