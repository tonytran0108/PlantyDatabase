    "name": "Agastache",
    "climate": [
        "Agastache thrives in temperate climates where summers are warm and winters are mild.",
        "This plant can tolerate a wide variety of climates but prefers environments that are not too humid.",
        "In more tropical climates, Agastache might struggle due to excessive moisture and high humidity.",
        "Cold climates with harsh winters require mulching to protect Agastache roots from freezing temperatures."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Agastache requires full sun exposure to bloom optimally and produce vibrant flowers.",
        "At least six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal for healthy growth.",
        "Plants may be grown in partial shade, but flowering and overall growth may be reduced.",
        "Ensure Agastache is not overshadowed by taller plants that might block necessary sunlight."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Agastache deeply but infrequently to encourage strong, deep root systems.",
        "During hot or dry spells, increase watering frequency to keep the plant healthy.",
        "Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can harm the plant.",
        "Reduce watering during the winter months when the plant is dormant."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Agastache prefers well-draining soil that prevents roots from sitting in water.",
        "Sandy or loamy soil that is rich in organic matter provides optimal conditions.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils unless amended with sand or compost for better drainage.",
        "A soil pH range from slightly acidic to neutral supports Agastache well."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead spent flowers regularly to encourage further blooming throughout the season.",
        "Divide plants every few years to maintain vigor and prevent them from becoming overcrowded.",
        "Apply a layer of mulch in autumn to protect roots during winter and retain soil moisture.",
        "Use organic fertilizers sparingly, as excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth."
