    "name": "Aglaonema Pictum Tricolor",
    "climate": [
        "Tropical climates with high humidity and warm temperatures are ideal.",
        "Prefers temperatures ranging from 18°C to 29°C throughout the year.",
        "Sensitive to cold; should not be exposed to temperatures below 15°C.",
        "Thrives in an environment that mimics a rainforest's warmth and moisture."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Prefers bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, leading to damage and discoloration.",
        "Filtered light through a window curtain is often best for its growth.",
        "Avoid placing in full shade as it may cause reduced variegation and growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Keep the soil consistently moist but avoid waterlogging, which can cause root rot.",
        "Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings for best results.",
        "Reduce watering frequency during the cooler months of the year.",
        "Misting can help maintain humidity, particularly in drier indoor environments."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Requires well-draining soil rich in organic matter for optimal health.",
        "A mix containing peat, perlite, and pine bark is often recommended.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils as they retain too much moisture, leading to root issues.",
        "The soil should support both moisture retention and adequate aeration."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Aglaonema plants contain calcium oxalate crystals which are toxic if ingested by pets and humans.",
        "Contact with the plant's sap can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Wipe the leaves occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust and improve photosynthesis.",
        "Rotate the plant regularly to ensure even growth and prevent lopsidedness."
