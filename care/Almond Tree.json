    "name": "Almond Tree",
    "climate": [
        "Almond trees thrive in Mediterranean climates with wet, mild winters.",
        "They prefer regions with long, hot summers for optimal fruit production.",
        "Areas with little to no late spring frosts are ideal for almond trees.",
        "The almond tree requires a region with low humidity to prevent diseases."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sunlight exposure is essential for healthy almond tree growth.",
        "Almond trees require at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Sufficient sunlight is crucial for almond trees to produce foliage and flowers.",
        "Inadequate sunlight can hinder the almond tree's fruiting capabilities significantly."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Almond trees need deep watering, especially during dry seasons to prosper.",
        "Consistent watering supports almond tree root development and growth.",
        "Almond trees should not be over-watered; root rot is a risk in poorly drained soil.",
        "Mature almond trees are somewhat drought tolerant but benefit from regular irrigation."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Almond trees prefer well-drained loamy soil for successful growth.",
        "The soil should be moderately fertile with a pH range of 6.0 to 8.5.",
        "Sandy loam soils are ideal, enabling appropriate water drainage and root expansion.",
        "Avoid heavy, clay-rich soils as they retain too much water and hinder root growth."
    ],
    "toxic": ["The leaves, bark, and seeds contain cyanogenic compounds which can be harmful if ingested."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pruning is crucial for almond tree health; it encourages sunlight penetration and air circulation."]
