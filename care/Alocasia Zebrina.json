    "soil": [
        "A well-draining potting mix that retains some moisture is ideal for Alocasia Zebrina.",
        "Aerated soil mixes, often used for aroid plants, work well due to the plant's root structure.",
        "Incorporate perlite or orchid bark to improve soil drainage and air circulation.",
        "Avoid compacted or heavy soils which do not allow for proper water drainage and root growth."
    ],
