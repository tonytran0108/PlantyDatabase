    "name": "Alyssum",
    "climate": [
        "Alyssum thrives best in temperate climates where temperatures are moderate.",
        "It can tolerate some heat if moisture in the soil is well-maintained.",
        "Cool-season Alyssum can also handle light frosts and cooler climates.",
        "High humidity can be tolerated, but ensure good air circulation to prevent rot."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun is ideal for Alyssum, encouraging abundant flowering.",
        "Alyssum can tolerate partial shade but may produce fewer blooms.",
        "It is best planted in a location where it receives at least six hours of sun.",
        "Avoid deep shade, as lack of light will lead to leggy and weak growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential; keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "In hot weather, Alyssum needs more frequent watering to prevent wilting.",
        "Reduce frequency in cooler months to prevent overwatering and root rot.",
        "Always check soil moisture level to ensure the optimal water supply."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Alyssum prefers well-draining soils to prevent root rot and other diseases.",
        "Soil should be rich in organic matter to support healthy growth.",
        "A neutral to slightly alkaline pH is preferred for optimal blooming.",
        "Avoid heavy, clay soils unless amended with sand or grit for drainage."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular deadheading can encourage more blooms and maintain plant appearance.",
        "Alyssum may benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer during active growth.",
        "Watch out for pests like aphids; prompt action can prevent infestations.",
        "In dense plantings, ensure air circulation to avoid fungal diseases."
