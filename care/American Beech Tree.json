    "climate": [
        "The American Beech Tree thrives in temperate climates with distinct seasons.",
        "Prefers climates with warm summers and cold winters, typical of its native range.",
        "It can tolerate a range of temperatures but is best suited for hardiness zones 3-9.",
        "Avoid planting in regions with extremely hot or dry climates, as it may not survive."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "American Beech Trees require full to partial sunlight for optimal growth.",
        "While they can tolerate some shade, too little light can affect their health.",
        "Plant in an area where they receive sun for at least 6 hours a day for best results.",
        "Ensure it does not receive direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day to prevent stress."

    "watering": [
        "American Beech Trees prefer consistently moist soil but hate waterlogged conditions.",
        "During dry spells, ensure they are watered deeply but less frequently to encourage deep roots.",
        "Regular watering is important during the first few years to establish the tree.",
        "Once established, these trees can survive short periods of drought, but prefer moisture."

    "soil": [
        "These trees thrive in well-draining, rich, loamy soil with excellent organic content.",
        "Avoid soils that are overly sandy or clay-heavy, as they can hinder growth.",
        "Soil should retain moisture but also provide enough drainage to prevent waterlogging.",
        "A pH range of 5.0 to 6.5 is ideal, though they can adapt to slightly different conditions."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Mulching is beneficial to retain soil moisture and provide organic nutrients.",
        "Prune only to remove dead or diseased branches to maintain natural shape.",
        "Protect young trees from animals like deer who may feed on the bark.",
        "Avoid damaging the shallow root system with heavy machinery or foot traffic."
