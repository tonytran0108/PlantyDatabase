    "name": "Anemone",
    "climate": [
        "Anemones thrive in temperate climates with cool, moist seasons and moderate temperatures.",
        "They prefer climates that do not experience extreme heat or severe cold for prolonged periods.",
        "In regions with a mild maritime climate, anemones can grow well, often along coastal areas.",
        "Some species are adapted to alpine climates, enduring colder temperatures with proper protection."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Anemones generally prefer partial sunlight, receiving filtered light through wooded canopies.",
        "Full sunlight can be tolerated if the climate is cooler or during the milder parts of the day.",
        "In hotter regions, providing afternoon shade can help prevent stress from intense sun exposure.",
        "Indirect or dappled sunlight is ideal, especially for woodland or shade-loving anemone varieties."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Anemones require consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out, particularly in their growing season.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot, especially in heavier, poorly-draining soils.",
        "During dry periods, anemones need supplemental watering to maintain soil moisture at optimal levels.",
        "In winter or dormant periods, reduced watering may be necessary to avoid excessive soil saturation."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is essential for anemones, preventing water retention that can cause root damage.",
        "A mix of loamy soil, enriched with organic matter like compost, supports healthy growth.",
        "Soil should be slightly acidic to neutral, with a pH level maintained between 6.0 and 7.0.",
        "For alpine or rock garden varieties, gritty or sandy soil enhances drainage and aeration around roots."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Mulching in winter helps protect the roots of anemones from freezing temperatures.",
        "Dividing clumps every few years can prevent overcrowding and promote healthier displays.",
        "Deadheading spent blooms encourages further flowering and prevents unwanted seeding.",
        "Supporting taller anemone species with stakes helps keep them upright during windy weather."
