    "watering": [
        "Water sparingly, as Angelina Stonecrop is drought-tolerant and prefers dry conditions.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; ensure soil dries out between waterings.",
        "In the growing season, water deeply but infrequently to encourage a strong root system.",
        "During winter dormancy, reduce watering significantly and only water when soil is completely dry."
