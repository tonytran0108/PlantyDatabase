    "name": "Angelita Daisy",
    "climate": [
        "Angelita Daisy thrives well in a temperate climate with cool nights to promote flowering.",
        "It is adaptable to a dry Mediterranean climate, where it benefits from sunny conditions.",
        "A semi-arid climate with low humidity is suitable for Angelita Daisy, avoiding excessive moisture.",
        "It can tolerate a subtropical climate as long as it receives adequate rain-free periods."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Angelita Daisy requires full sunlight exposure for most of the day to bloom optimally.",
        "Partial shade is tolerated, but too much shade can hinder its flowering potential.",
        "Direct sunlight during the morning and early afternoon is ideal for robust growth.",
        "Avoid planting in full shade, as a lack of sunlight can lead to leggy growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Angelita Daisy deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root development.",
        "Allow the soil to dry out between watering to prevent root rot and other diseases.",
        "In containers, ensure adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging of its roots.",
        "During hot periods, additional watering might be necessary to maintain bloom."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained soil is essential for Angelita Daisy to prevent water accumulation.",
        "Sandy or loamy soil with adequate organic matter provides optimal growing conditions.",
        "Avoid clay soils that retain water, as this can lead to root rot in Angelita Daisy.",
        "A slightly alkaline to neutral soil pH level will promote better growth and flowering."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadheading spent flowers will encourage continuous blooming throughout growing seasons.",
        "Mulching around the base can help retain moisture and suppress weed growth effectively."
