    "sunlight": [
        "Angelonia grows best in full sun, needing at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "In partial shade, the plant may still grow but might not bloom as prolifically as in full sun.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can result in leggy growth and fewer flowers, impacting its ornamental appeal.",
        "While it can handle some partial shade, maximizing sun exposure encourages vibrant blooms."

    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is crucial during the growing season, especially in hot weather, to ensure healthy growth.",
        "It's essential to let the soil dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, as Angelonia doesn't like overly wet roots.",
        "During hot spells, more frequent watering may be necessary, but it's important to avoid waterlogging the soil.",
        "In winter or cooler months, watering frequency should be reduced significantly to prevent overwatering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Angelonia prefers well-draining soil enriched with organic matter, facilitating robust growth.",
        "A mixture of garden soil with perlite or sand can enhance drainage and prevent water retention issues.",
        "Good-quality potting mix also works well for container plants, ensuring they receive enough nutrients.",
        "The plant tolerates a range of soil conditions but struggles in heavy, compacted soils without proper drainage."
