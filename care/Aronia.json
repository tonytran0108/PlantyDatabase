    "name": "Aronia",
    "climate": [
        "Aronia plants thrive best in temperate climates where seasons are distinct.",
        "They are hardy and can tolerate cold winters typical in temperate regions.",
        "While resilient, optimal growth is achieved with moderate summers.",
        "Regions with a distinct winter and summer cycle are ideal for aronia."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Aronia bushes prefer full sun for optimal fruit and flower production.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but might yield less fruit if shaded too often.",
        "Exposure to at least six hours of direct sunlight each day is recommended.",
        "Direct sunlight supports healthy growth and helps prevent diseases."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water aronia regularly, especially in the first few years of growth.",
        "Once established, they are fairly drought-tolerant but appreciate moisture.",
        "Ensure soil is well-drained to avoid waterlogging, which can harm roots.",
        "In drier periods, increase watering to prevent stress and promote fruiting."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Aronia plants are adaptable to a variety of soils but prefer acidic to neutral.",
        "Well-drained loamy soil that retains moisture is ideal for aronia cultivation.",
        "They can grow in poorer soils but benefit from organic matter additions.",
        "Compacted or poorly-drained soils can impede root growth and should be improved."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune aronia shrubs in late winter to remove dead wood and stimulate growth."
