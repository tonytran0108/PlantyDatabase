    "name": "Artemisia",
    "climate": [
        "Artemisia thrives in temperate climates with dry and warm summers, often found in regions with Mediterranean-style weather.",
        "This plant can be tolerant of various climates but prefers areas that do not experience extremely cold winters or humid conditions.",
        "In its natural habitat, Artemisia is adapted to climates with well-defined seasons and minimal rainfall during the summer months.",
        "Ideal climates for Artemisia cultivation include areas where temperatures remain moderate throughout the growing season, avoiding harsh frosts."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Artemisia prefers full sunlight to promote healthy growth, requiring at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Although it can tolerate partial shade, full sun exposure ensures that Artemisia achieves its characteristic dense foliage and aromatic qualities.",
        "Without adequate sunlight, Artemisia may become leggy or fail to develop its distinctive silver-gray appearance effectively.",
        "Ideally, Artemisia should be planted in locations with unobstructed sunlight for most of the day to meet its light requirements."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Artemisia requires minimal watering and does best in environments where the soil is allowed to dry out between waterings.",
        "Overwatering is a common mistake with Artemisia, as it is drought-tolerant and prefers dryer conditions typical of its native habitat.",
        "During the growing season, Artemisia should be watered sparingly, just enough to prevent complete desiccation of its roots.",
        "Inadequate drainage or excessive moisture retention in the soil can lead to root rot, a common issue if water needs are mismanaged."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Artemisia thrives in well-drained soils that mimic its natural rocky and sandy environments, preventing water-logged conditions.",
        "Soils with poor fertility often benefit Artemisia, as it prefers lean, gritty substrates that prevent excessive moisture retention.",
        "Ideally, the soil for Artemisia should have good aeration and moderate to low levels of organic matter to replicate its native soil conditions.",
        "Artemisia is exceptionally tolerant of poor soils, and excessive nutrients can sometimes inhibit its optimal growth, making sandy loams ideal."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Some Artemisia species contain toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested by humans or animals, particularly pets.",
        "The toxicity often arises from the presence of thujone, a chemical that can cause adverse effects when consumed in significant amounts."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning Artemisia regularly helps maintain its shape and prevents it from becoming woody, promoting vibrant new growth.",
        "Deadheading spent flowers can encourage bushier growth and prevent unwanted self-seeding in garden environments."
