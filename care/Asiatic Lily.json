    "name": "Asiatic Lily",
    "climate": [
        "Asiatic Lilies thrive in temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes.",
        "They grow well in regions where summers are warm, but not extremely hot.",
        "They are tolerant of cooler climates and can withstand some frost conditions.",
        "Humidity levels should be moderate for optimal growth of Asiatic Lilies."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Asiatic Lilies require full sun, meaning they need at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but blooming may be less prolific without enough light.",
        "Avoid locations with dense shade as this can lead to weak growth and fewer flowers.",
        "The more sunlight Asiatic Lilies receive, the stronger the stems and healthier the plant."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Asiatic Lilies need regular watering, especially during their growth and blooming periods.",
        "It is important to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "Water the lilies deeply once a week, ensuring the soil is thoroughly moistened.",
        "During dry periods or hotter weather, increase watering frequency to maintain moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is crucial for preventing bulb rot in Asiatic Lilies.",
        "A loamy soil rich in organic matter will promote healthy growth and blooms.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, ideally between 6.0 and 7.0.",
        "Amending soil with compost can improve drainage, aeration, and nutrient content."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Asiatic Lilies are highly toxic to cats, causing kidney failure if ingested.",
        "Symptoms of poisoning in cats include vomiting, lethargy, and lack of appetite.",
        "Immediate veterinary attention is required if a cat is suspected of ingesting any part of the plant.",
        "It is advisable to keep Asiatic Lilies out of reach of pets, especially cats."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead spent flowers to encourage further blooming and prevent seed setting.",
        "In colder climates, apply a mulch layer to protect bulbs from harsh winter conditions.",
        "Stake tall-growing varieties to prevent the stems from breaking in strong winds.",
        "Divide clumps every few years to maintain vigor and prevent overcrowding of bulbs."
