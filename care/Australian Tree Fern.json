    "name": "Australian Tree Fern",
    "climate": [
        "The Australian Tree Fern thrives in tropical climates, enjoying warm temperatures, high humidity, and moist conditions.",
        "This fern is accustomed to subtropical climates, where moderate to high humidity and consistent warmth prevail.",
        "It can adapt to temperate climates but may require protection from frost and cold winds to ensure optimal growth.",
        "In ideal conditions, this plant prefers environments with mild, humidity, consistently above 50%, and steady, warm temperatures."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "The Australian Tree Fern prefers partial shade, where it receives filtered light similar to its natural forest understory habitat.",
        "Full sun exposure can lead to leaf burn, so it benefits from morning sun but is best sheltered from harsh afternoon rays.",
        "It tolerates deep shade, but growth may be slower, requiring patience and care in low light environments.",
        "Sites with dappled sunlight are ideal, creating a balance between sufficient light and protection from direct sun."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "This fern requires consistently moist soil, thriving in environments that mimic its natural rainforest conditions.",
        "Avoid waterlogging the soil as it can lead to root rot; proper drainage is essential for healthy growth.",
        "Frequent watering during dry periods is necessary to maintain humidity and prevent the plant from drying out.",
        "Ensure the substrate remains evenly moist, adjusting the watering schedule to seasonal changes in temperature and humidity."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "The ideal soil for Australian Tree Fern is rich, organic, and well-draining, allowing sufficient air around the roots.",
        "It thrives in soils that are high in organic matter, such as peat or compost-based mixtures, to maintain moisture and nutrients.",
        "A loamy soil texture, capable of retaining moisture while draining excess water, is beneficial for this plant.",
        "To promote optimal growth, a slightly acidic to neutral pH level in the soil is preferable for this fern species."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "There is limited evidence on the toxicity of the Australian Tree Fern; however, it is generally considered non-toxic to pets and humans."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular misting can help increase humidity around the plant, preventing the fronds from drying out.",
        "In colder climates, consider bringing the fern indoors or covering it during cold snaps to protect it from frost damage.",
        "Ensure good air circulation around the fern to prevent fungal infections such as powdery mildew on the leaves.",
        "Regularly remove dead or yellowing fronds to encourage new growth and maintain the plant's aesthetic appearance."
