    "name": "Autumn Sage",
    "climate": ["Autumn Sage thrives best in climates that experience mild winters, as it is sensitive to frost.", "The plant is well-suited to climates with dry, hot summers and can tolerate drought conditions.", "In Mediterranean climates, where there is wet winter and hot, dry summer, it flourishes well.", "It can handle heat and humidity but may struggle in consistently wet, cold climates."],
    "sunlight": ["It prefers full sun exposure, which ensures the most vibrant flower production.", "Partial shade can be tolerated, especially in extremely hot climates to prevent sun scorch.", "In environments with high sun exposure, it can manage better if given some afternoon shade.", "Maximum flower development occurs with a minimum of six to eight hours of direct sunlight."],
    "watering": ["Watering should be moderate, allowing the soil to dry between waterings to prevent root rot.", "During dry spells, ensure deep watering to reach the roots, mimicking drought resilience.", "Overwatering may lead to fungal diseases; it thrives in well-drained environments.", "It requires less water in cooler months, reducing to minimal as temperature drops."],
    "soil": ["Prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soils rich in organic matter to support growth.", "Avoid heavy clay soils unless amended with organic matter to enhance drainage.", "It tolerates poor soils but thrives in soil with neutral to slightly alkaline pH.", "Soil should be light and airy allowing proper root development and nutrient uptake."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pruning encourages bushier growth and prolongs the blooming period of the plant.", "Protect the plant from freezing temperatures, which can cause dieback.", "Consider mulching to conserve moisture and insulate roots in temperature extremes.", "Regular deadheading of flowers will promote continuous blooming throughout the season."]
