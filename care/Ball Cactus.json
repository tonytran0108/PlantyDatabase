    "name": "Ball Cactus",
    "climate": [
        "Ball Cactus thrives in arid desert climates with high temperatures during the day.",
        "This plant is adapted to survive in regions with low rainfall and dry air.",
        "It can also tolerate cool nights if the days are warm, mimicking desert conditions.",
        "The Ball Cactus prefers environments with minimal humidity and lots of sunshine."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Ball Cactus requires full sun exposure to grow healthy and maintain its shape.",
        "Place the cactus in a location where it receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Insufficient light can lead to poor growth and an elongated, unhealthy cactus.",
        "In intense or very bright sun, some protection might be needed to avoid sunburn."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water the Ball Cactus sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings.",
        "Over-watering is a common mistake, leading to root rot and other health issues.",
        "During the growing season, water moderately, and reduce frequency in winter.",
        "Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the roots."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Ball Cactus grows best in a well-draining cactus or succulent potting mix.",
        "The soil should be gritty, allowing water to pass through rapidly without retaining moisture.",
        "A mix containing sand, perlite, or volcanic rock improves drainage and aeration.",
        "Avoid dense, heavy soils that retain water and compromise root health for the cactus."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Rotate the Ball Cactus periodically to ensure even sun exposure and prevent leaning.",
        "Avoid placing the cactus near cold drafts or extreme temperature fluctuations.",
        "In case of pests like spider mites, treat with appropriate insecticidal soap or neem oil.",
        "Repot the cactus every few years in a slightly larger pot to accommodate growth."
