    "climate": [
        "Bell peppers thrive in warm climates where temperatures are consistently high.",
        "They require a growing environment that is free from frost at all stages of their life.",
        "Temperatures for bell pepper cultivation should ideally range between 70°F and 85°F (21°C to 29°C).",
        "Bell peppers do not tolerate cold weather, so ensure planting after the last frost."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Bell peppers require full sun exposure for optimal growth and fruit production.",
        "They need at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day to develop properly.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggier plants and reduced fruit yields in bell peppers.",
        "Position your bell pepper plants in a spot with abundant sun for best results."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is crucial for bell pepper plants to prevent wilting and stress.",
        "Water deeply so that moisture reaches the root zone, ideally in the morning.",
        "Soil should remain consistently moist but not soggy to avoid root rot in bell peppers.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and reduce the frequency of watering needed."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Bell peppers prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter for optimal growth.",
        "A pH level between 6.0 and 6.8 is considered ideal for cultivating bell peppers.",
        "Soil should be amended with compost or aged manure to enhance nutrient content.",
        "Ensure soil is loose and can effectively support the root system of the plants."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To support heavy fruit loads, staking or caging bell pepper plants can be beneficial.",
        "Regular foliar feeding with a balanced fertilizer can boost growth and yield.",
        "Keep an eye out for pests like aphids and tomato hornworms, which can damage plants.",
        "Pruning excess foliage can improve airflow and reduce disease risk in bell peppers."
