    "name": "Bergenia",
    "climate": [
        "Bergenia thrive in temperate climates where they can experience cooler temperatures.",
        "They can adapt to a range of conditions but perform best in cool, mountainous regions.",
        "A moderate climate with mild summers and cold winters is ideal for Bergenia cultivation.",
        "Bergenias are adaptable but prefer climates without extreme heat or humidity."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Bergenia can grow in full sun to partial shade, though they prefer partial shade.",
        "In shady areas, Bergenias will still bloom, though sun helps achieve vibrant colors.",
        "They tolerate full sun but may require more moisture to prevent leaf burn.",
        "These plants thrive in dappled sunlight, providing balanced light exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Bergenia prefers consistent moisture but not waterlogged conditions.",
        "It's important to water them regularly, especially in hot, dry periods.",
        "Reduce watering in winter as Bergenia are less active and need less moisture.",
        "Ensuring well-drained soil helps prevent root rot from overwatering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained soil is crucial for Bergenia to prevent root rot and promote health.",
        "They prefer loamy soil rich in organic matter for optimal growth.",
        "Soil should retain moisture yet allow excess water to escape easily.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels are best suited for Bergenia."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To encourage dense foliage, remove dead leaves and flowers regularly.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and provide gentle protection.",
        "Divide and replant Bergenia every few years to prevent overcrowding.",
        "Protect from extreme weather; a layer of mulch can help during frosts."
