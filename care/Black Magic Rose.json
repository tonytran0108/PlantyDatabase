    "name": "Black Magic Rose",
    "climate": ["Black Magic Roses benefit from growing in warm climates that replicate their natural habitat and allow for optimal blooming.", "These roses prefer environments with seasonal changes that encourage growth and flowering cycles.", "High humidity can encourage disease, so these roses thrive in drier climates where air circulates freely.", "They are sensitive to cold temperatures, so a climate that avoids harsh winters is preferable for their growth."],
    "sunlight": ["Black Magic Roses require full sunlight, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth.", "While they need full sun, too much harsh afternoon sun can stress them, so morning exposure is ideal.", "Insufficient sunlight can result in fewer blooms and weaker growth, making ample sunlight crucial.", "These roses need a balance of light to protect blooms from scorching while ensuring robust flowering."],
    "watering": ["Water Black Magic Roses deeply to ensure that the moisture reaches the roots, encouraging healthy growth.", "Frequent shallow watering can lead to weak root systems, so deeper, less frequent watering is preferred.", "Ensure the soil drains well to prevent root rot; waterlogged roots can harm the plant.", "In extremely hot weather, more frequent watering may be necessary to prevent the plant from drying out."],
    "soil": ["Black Magic Roses require well-draining soil rich in organic matter to help retain the right balance of moisture.", "The soil should have a slightly acidic to neutral pH, ideally around 6.0 to 6.8, to ensure nutrients are available.", "Compacted or heavy clay soils can hinder growth, so amending with compost or sand can improve conditions.", "Nutrient-rich loam is ideal as it supports both drainage and nutrient retention, aiding rose health."],
    "toxic": ["Black Magic Roses are not generally considered toxic, but the thorns can cause injury if care is not taken."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pruning Black Magic Roses regularly promotes more prolific blooming and air circulation, reducing disease risk.", "Applying a quality rose fertilizer in the growing season supports lush growth and abundant flowering."]
