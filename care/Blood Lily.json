    "name": "Blood Lily",
    "climate": ["Blood Lilies thrive in warm climates, typically tropical regions. They prefer environments where temperatures remain consistently moderate to warm.", "These plants do not tolerate frost well and are best suited for climates that do not experience severe cold periods.", "Humidity levels should be moderately high for optimal growth, mimicking their natural tropical habitat.", "In colder climates, Blood Lilies should be grown indoors or in a greenhouse to maintain the necessary warmth."],
    "sunlight": ["Blood Lilies grow best in partial sunlight where they receive bright light but are protected from direct afternoon sun.", "Direct sunlight, especially during the hottest part of the day, can scorch the leaves and flowers of the plant.", "Morning sun with afternoon shade is ideal for Blood Lilies to thrive and maintain vibrant blooms.", "Providing dappled light can also simulate the natural understory lighting conditions they prefer."],
    "watering": ["Water Blood Lilies regularly during their active growing season, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged.", "During the dormant period, reduce watering significantly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.", "Ensure good drainage, as standing water can lead to root rot, a common problem for these bulbs.", "In high humidity environments, adjust the watering frequency to prevent over-saturation."],
    "soil": ["Blood Lilies prefer rich, well-draining soil with plenty of organic matter to mimic their native conditions.", "A potting mix designed for tropical plants, with added perlite or sand, can improve drainage.", "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral to ensure the Blood Lily absorbs nutrients effectively.", "Regularly amend with compost or a balanced fertilizer to maintain soil fertility throughout the growing season."],
    "toxic": ["Blood Lilies are toxic if ingested, containing compounds that can cause stomach upset and serious health issues.", "Human and pet ingestion of any part of the plant, especially bulbs and seeds, should be avoided.", "Symptoms of poisoning may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, requiring immediate medical attention.", "Handling the plant requires caution, and washing hands afterward is recommended to avoid irritation."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["When grown indoors, ensure Blood Lilies have good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.", "Consider using a pebble tray with water beneath your plant to increase humidity.", "Repot every few years to refresh the soil and provide more room for bulb expansion and division.", "Monitor for pests such as mealybugs and spider mites, and treat with appropriate organic or chemical methods."]
