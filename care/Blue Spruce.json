    "sunlight": ["Blue Spruce trees prefer full sunlight for optimal growth and vibrant color.", "Partial shade can be tolerated but may lead to a reduction in growth speed and fullness.", "They need at least six hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight per day for peak health.", "Insufficient sunlight can also lead to a thinner canopy and faded needle color."],
    "watering": ["Young Blue Spruce trees require consistent watering, especially during dry spells.", "Established trees are more drought-tolerant but still benefit from deep watering.", "Watering should be consistent to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged or soggy.", "Proper hydration is important to prevent stress and maintain vibrant blue needle color."],
