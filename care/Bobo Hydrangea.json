    "name": "Bobo Hydrangea",
    "climate": [
        "Bobo Hydrangeas thrive in temperate climates where winters are cold enough to encourage dormancy and summers are not excessively hot.",
        "They prefer regions with well-defined seasons, including a cool to cold winter, and they do not do well in tropical climates.",
        "These plants can survive in USDA hardiness zones 3 through 9, adapting to a range of climatic conditions within this spectrum.",
        "A moist climate with good rainfall distribution throughout the year supports their healthy growth and blooming."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Bobo Hydrangeas grow best in locations with full sun to part shade, with at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "In hotter climates, providing afternoon shade can help protect the plant from intense midday sun.",
        "While they can tolerate some shade, excessive darkness reduces blooming and may lead to leggy growth.",
        "Bright morning sunlight coupled with afternoon shade is ideal, helping to preserve vibrancy and flower integrity."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "During hot, dry spells, more frequent watering might be needed, but avoid allowing the soil to completely dry out.",
        "Deep watering once or twice a week encourages a deep root system, helping the plant endure drought conditions.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain moisture, reducing the need for watering while providing a stable environment."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Bobo Hydrangeas prefer rich, well-draining soils with a high organic matter content for optimal growth.",
        "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral; pH levels between 5.5 and 6.5 are ideal for blooming vibrancy.",
        "Clay-based or compacted soils should be amended with compost or peat moss to improve drainage and aeration.",
        "Regular applications of balanced, slow-release fertilizers can enhance soil fertility and support healthy growth."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Hydrangeas contain cyanogenic glycosides in their leaves and flowers, which can be toxic to pets and humans if ingested.",
        "Consuming parts of the plant may result in vomiting, abdominal pain, and lethargy due to the release of cyanide."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning in late winter or early spring removes dead wood and encourages strong growth and prolific blooming.",
        "Protect the plant with burlap or mulch during extreme winter conditions to prevent cold damage to the roots and stems."
