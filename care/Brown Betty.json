    "climate": ["Brown Betty plants typically thrive in moderate to warm climates with temperatures around 60-75°F.", "These plants are not frost-tolerant and need to be protected from freezing temperatures.", "They can survive in lower humidity environments, making them suitable for indoor growing.", "Avoid extremely hot or cold climates, as extreme temperatures can harm the plant."],
    "sunlight": ["Brown Betty plants prefer indirect sunlight, ideally in a bright room.","Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves and cause damage to the plant.","These plants can also adapt to moderate light conditions, but not low light.","If grown outdoors, ensure they receive partial shade to avoid sunburn."],
    "watering": ["Watering needs can vary; ensure the top 1-inch of soil is dry before watering again.","Brown Betty plants prefer consistent but not excessive watering to avoid root rot.","In drier climates, you may need to water more often to maintain moisture.","Reduce watering frequency in winter to prevent overwatering and root damage."],
    "soil": ["Use well-draining potting soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot.","A mix containing peat, perlite, and coarse sand is ideal for these plants.","Heavy, clay soils should be avoided as they can retain too much moisture.","Ensure the pot has drainage holes to allow excess water to escape easily."],
