    "name": "Brunnera",
    "climate": ["Brunnera plants prefer a temperate climate, thriving well in cool conditions without extreme heat.", "These plants are well-suited to climates with mild summers and cold winters.", "The climate should resemble woodland or forest edges where temperatures are moderate.", "Brunnera can tolerate some variation in climate but do best in stable, mild conditions."],
    "sunlight": ["Brunnera plants thrive best in partial shade, as too much sun can scorch the leaves.", "In their natural habitat, they often grow under the dappled canopy of taller plants or trees.", "While they can tolerate full shade, their flowering may be reduced without sufficient light.", "Morning sun is ideal, as it provides gentle light without the intense heat of midday."],
    "watering": ["Brunnera needs consistent moisture, so keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.", "It is important to provide regular watering, especially during dry periods or hot weather.", "While they prefer moist soil, overwatering can lead to root rot, so drainage is important.", "Watering early in the day is recommended to allow excess moisture to evaporate by evening."],
    "soil": ["Brunnera thrives in rich, well-draining soil that retains some moisture yet drains excess water.", "A soil mix with high organic matter content helps support healthy growth and flowering.", "The soil should remain consistently moist, and mulching can help retain soil moisture.", "Loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH is ideal for growing Brunnera successfully."],
    "toxic": ["Brunnera is not generally considered toxic to humans or pets, but ingestion is still not advised."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Deadheading spent flowers can help promote a neat appearance and encourage more blooms."]
