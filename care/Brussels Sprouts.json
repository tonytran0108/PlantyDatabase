    "name": "Brussels Sprouts",
    "climate": [
        "Brussels sprouts thrive in a temperate climate, which is crucial for their development.",
        "They require a cool climate and can tolerate light frost, enhancing flavor.",
        "Excessive heat can affect the growth, making cooler temperatures preferable.",
        "A consistent growing climate, avoiding extremes, helps in producing quality sprouts."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Brussels sprouts require full sunlight exposure for optimal growth.",
        "Consistent sunlight helps in robust sprout formation and healthy plants.",
        "Avoid shading to ensure they receive at least 6 hours of sun daily.",
        "Sunlight aids in preventing diseases by promoting healthy leaf growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential, keeping the soil evenly moist for sprouts.",
        "Avoid water stress as it can impair the growth of Brussels sprouts.",
        "Consistent moisture aids in developing firm, well-formed sprouts.",
        "Water deeply but ensure adequate drainage to prevent root rot."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter boosts growth.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH soil range, from 6.0 to 6.8, is ideal.",
        "Compact soil can hinder root growth, so tilling helps in aeration.",
        "Ensure soil retains moisture yet drains excess to prevent waterlogging."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly remove yellowing lower leaves to prevent disease.",
        "Fertilize with a nitrogen-rich formula to encourage leafy growth.",
        "Staking can prevent toppling in windy areas or if plants become tall.",
        "Watch for pests like aphids, controlling them with appropriate measures."
