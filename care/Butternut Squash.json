    "name": "Butternut Squash",
    "climate": ["Butternut squash thrives in a warm season climate and requires full sun.", "This plant does best when grown in a region with a consistent warm temperature.", "It is not frost-tolerant and grows best in areas with long, warm growing seasons.", "A temperate climate with a long summer growing period is ideal for optimal growth."],
    "sunlight": ["Requires full sunlight exposure for at least six to eight hours daily.", "Plants need uninterrupted direct sunlight to produce healthy fruit.", "Growing in partial shade will result in poor fruit development.", "Full sun enhances photosynthesis, critical for the plant’s growth and yield."],
    "watering": ["Requires regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil.", "Inadequate water can result in poor fruit development and reduced yield.", "Avoid waterlogging; consistent moisture without soaking is ideal.", "Drip irrigation systems are recommended to conserve water and ensure even distribution."],
    "soil": ["Prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soil with good organic content.", "A soil pH between 6.0 to 7.5 is most suitable for robust growth.", "Heavy clay soils should be amended to allow proper drainage.", "Regular soil enrichment with compost or aged manure improves fertility."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Ensure consistent weeding to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.", "Mulching helps in moisture retention and suppresses weed growth effectively.", "Prune vines judiciously to increase airflow and prevent rot or disease.", "Hand pollination can improve fruit set if pollinator activity is low."]
