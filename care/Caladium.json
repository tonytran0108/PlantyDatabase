    "name": "Caladium",
    "climate": [
        "Caladiums thrive in warm, tropical climates with high humidity and consistent temperatures.",
        "They are native to South America and prefer environments with no frost or sudden temperature changes.",
        "These plants do best in climates where the temperature does not drop below 60°F (15°C).",
        "Caladiums are sensitive to cold and need a warm growing season to develop fully."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Caladiums prefer indirect sunlight, as direct sunlight can scorch their delicate leaves.",
        "They grow well in partial shade, making them ideal for indoor spaces with filtered light.",
        "It is important to protect caladiums from the harsh midday sun, which can damage foliage.",
        "In a garden setting, planting them under trees or shaded areas helps maintain their vibrant colors."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Caladiums require consistent moisture, but the soil should not be waterlogged to prevent root rot.",
        "It is important to water them regularly, especially during dry periods to keep the soil damp.",
        "These plants can benefit from misting during hot or dry days to increase humidity around them.",
        "Watering should be reduced in fall and winter as the plant enters a dormant phase and needs less moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Caladiums grow best in well-drained soil enriched with organic matter to support healthy growth.",
        "A mixture of peat moss, loamy soil, and perlite or sand will create the ideal soil conditions.",
        "The soil should retain moisture yet drain well to avoid waterlogging and potential root issues.",
        "They require a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ranging from 5.5 to 6.5, for optimal growth."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Caladiums are toxic to pets and humans if ingested, causing irritation or swelling in the mouth.",
        "Ingestion may lead to severe discomfort, including stomach pain, vomiting, and difficulty breathing.",
        "Handling the plant can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, so use caution when pruning.",
        "Keep caladiums out of reach of small children and pets to prevent accidental ingestion or contact."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Caladiums may benefit from a regular application of a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season.",
        "They can be grown as annuals in colder climates by planting bulbs in early spring after the last frost.",
        "In zones where they are not hardy, caladium tubers should be dug up and stored indoors during winter.",
        "Make sure to remove any fading or yellowing leaves promptly to encourage the healthy growth of new foliage."
