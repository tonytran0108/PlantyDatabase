    "name": "Camellia",
    "climate": [
        "Camellias thrive in regions with mild, temperate climates and low humidity.",
        "This plant prefers cool winters and moderate summer temperatures overall.",
        "Regions with a coastal climate are generally ideal for camellias to grow well.",
        "Avoid very hot, dry areas as camellias may not perform well in such climates."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Camellias prefer partial shade, especially during the hot afternoon hours.",
        "Morning sun with afternoon shade is ideal to prevent leaf scorch and stress.",
        "In cooler climates, camellias can tolerate more direct sunlight exposure.",
        "Too much direct sunlight can lead to leaf burn and negatively impact flowering."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Camellias need consistent moisture, but the soil should never be waterlogged.",
        "Deep watering is preferred over frequent, shallow watering to encourage roots.",
        "Ensure the soil is well-draining to prevent root rot due to excess water.",
        "During periods of drought, increase the watering frequency to sustain the plant."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Camellias require acidic soil, with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5 for thriving.",
        "Well-draining, loose soil rich in organic matter is essential for camellias.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soil or alkaline soil, which will hinder healthy growth.",
        "Amend the soil with pine bark or peat to enhance drainage and acidity levels."

    "toxic": [
        "Camellia plants are generally non-toxic but may cause mild irritation if ingested by pets."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune camellias after blooming to maintain shape and encourage bushy growth."
