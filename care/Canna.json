    "name": "Canna",
    "climate": ["Canna plants thrive in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures are consistently warm.", "In their native environment, Cannas grow in climates that are humid with plenty of rainfall.", "They can tolerate temperate climates but prefer climates without harsh cold conditions.", "Canna plants do not perform well in frosty conditions and require protection in such climates."],
    "sunlight": ["Canna plants require full sun exposure to perform at their best and produce vibrant blooms.", "They thrive in direct sunlight which helps them develop strong and healthy foliage.", "Partial shade can be tolerated, but it may result in fewer and less colorful flowers.", "Cannas should be planted in locations where they receive at least six hours of sunlight each day."],
    "watering": ["Consistent watering is important for Cannas, especially during dry periods or in containers.", "They appreciate moisture-retentive soil to ensure that the roots do not dry out.", "Canna plants may need daily watering in extremely hot weather to stay hydrated.", "Overwatering should be avoided; the soil should be damp but never waterlogged."],
    "soil": ["Cannas prefer rich, well-draining soil that is high in organic content for best growth.", "Soil should be loose and fertile, providing good drainage and air circulation for roots.", "A soil pH that is slightly acidic to neutral, ranging from 6.0 to 7.0, is suitable for Cannas.", "Amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve nutrient availability."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Regular deadheading of spent flowers can encourage the plant to produce more blooms.", "In colder regions, tubers should be lifted and stored indoors during winter to prevent freezing.", "Applying a layer of mulch can help retain moisture and protect roots from temperature fluctuations.", "Fertilize Cannas during the growing season to support their growth and flowering potential."]
