    "soil": [
        "Well-drained, sandy loam soil is ideal for growing healthy carnations.",
        "A soil pH of 6.0 to 7.0 is preferred to accommodate nutrient absorption.",
        "Improve soil with organic matter to enhance drainage and fertility.",
        "Heavy clay soils should be amended to improve aeration and prevent water stagnation."
