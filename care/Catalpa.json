    "sunlight": [
        "Catalpa trees prefer full sun exposure to grow and bloom to their fullest potential.",
        "While they can tolerate partial shade, too much shade will inhibit flowering and growth.",
        "Planting in a location with at least six hours of direct sunlight daily is ideal.",

        "Young Catalpa trees require more frequent watering until they establish a deep root system.",
        "Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot and other issues."

    "soil": [
        "Catalpa trees can adapt to a variety of soil types but prefer well-drained soil conditions.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels are ideal for promoting healthy growth and blooms.",
        "They can tolerate poor soil quality; however, rich, fertile soil enhances their development.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that do not drain well, as this can lead to root problems."
