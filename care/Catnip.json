    "sunlight": [
        "Catnip grows best in full sun, which ensures robust and aromatic leaves.",
        "Partial shade is tolerable for catnip but may result in less vigorous growth.",
        "Ensure it receives at least six hours of direct sunlight each day for optimal growth.",

        "Drought-tolerant once established, but regular watering encourages better growth.",
        "Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.",
        "In containers, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging and root damage."

    "soil": [
        "Catnip prefers well-draining soil with moderate fertility for ideal growth.",
        "A sandy loam soil amended with organic matter suits catnip perfectly.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain too much moisture and can cause root rot.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, ideally between 6.1 and 7.8."
