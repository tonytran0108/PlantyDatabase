    "sunlight": [
        "Cayenne peppers need full sunlight to grow well, requiring at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can cause leggy plants and reduce fruit production significantly.",
        "A south-facing garden or windowsill is ideal for maximizing exposure to sunlight.",
        "Ensuring proper sunlight exposure can enhance the heat and flavor of the cayenne peppers."

    "soil": [
        "Cayenne peppers grow best in well-drained, fertile loamy soil with good organic matter content.",
        "The ideal soil pH for cayenne peppers ranges from 6.0 to 6.8 for optimal nutrient absorption.",
        "In poor soil conditions, adding compost or aged manure can enhance soil fertility.",
