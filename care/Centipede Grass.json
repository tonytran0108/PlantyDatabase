    "name": "Centipede Grass",
    "climate": ["Centipede Grass thrives in warm, humid environments, commonly found in southeastern United States.", "This grass is particularly well-suited for subtropical climates, preferring temperatures between 60°F and 95°F.", "Areas with moderate rainfall and humidity levels are ideal for Centipede Grass to grow consistently and healthily.", "It does not tolerate frost well and can be damaged by freezing temperatures during harsh winters."],
    "sunlight": ["Centipede Grass requires full sunlight exposure to grow optimally and maintain its vibrant green color.", "Partial shade can be tolerated, but it may lead to thinner, less dense turf over time if sunlight is insufficient.", "For healthy growth, at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day is recommended for Centipede Grass.", "Shaded areas may require additional care or overseeding with shade-tolerant species to maintain uniform coverage."],
    "watering": ["Centipede Grass needs regular watering, especially during dry spells to maintain its lush appearance.", "A deep watering schedule is preferable, approximately 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week.", "Avoid frequent shallow watering, as it encourages shallow roots and can lead to poor drought resistance.", "Overwatering should be avoided as well, as it can lead to root rot and fungal diseases affecting the grass."],
    "soil": ["Centipede Grass prefers acidic soils, typically with a pH level between 5.0 and 6.0 for best growth results.", "It performs well in sandy, well-drained soils but can adapt to various soil types if properly managed.", "Compacted or heavy clay soils may impede growth and require aeration to improve drainage and health.", "Soil should be well-aerated for optimal growth; periodic aeration helps promote strong root development."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Centipede Grass should be fertilized sparingly, usually once per year in late spring for best results.", "Minimal mowing is required, as Centipede Grass is a slow-growing turf; keep it mowed to about 1.5 to 2 inches.","Regular monitoring for pests like mole crickets and nematodes is necessary to prevent lawn damage.", "Thatch can build up over time; periodic dethatching may be needed to ensure healthy growth and appearance."]
