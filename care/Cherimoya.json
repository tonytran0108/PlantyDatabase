    "name": "Cherimoya",
    "climate": ["Cherimoya thrives in subtropical to mild temperate climates with protection from frost.", "The plant prefers areas where temperatures do not drop below freezing.", "Ideal climate zones for cherimoya include USDA Zones 9 through 11.", "Cherimoya can tolerate short periods of mild freezing weather when dormant."],
    "sunlight": ["Cherimoya trees require full sun for optimal growth and fruit production.", "In hotter climates, cherimoya may benefit from partial shade during peak sun hours.", "The plant needs at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day.", "Avoid planting cherimoya in areas with heavy shade as it can inhibit growth."],
    "watering": ["Cherimoya needs regular watering during the growing season, especially in dry conditions.", "Water young trees more frequently to establish a robust root system.", "During fruit development, consistent watering will help improve fruit quality.", "Overwatering should be avoided as cherimoya is prone to root rot in soggy soil."],
    "soil": ["Cherimoya prefers well-drained, sandy to loamy soils which prevent waterlogging.", "Soil should have a slightly acidic to neutral pH for optimal growth.", "Enriching soil with organic matter like compost will improve fertility.", "Avoid heavy clay soils as they can impair drainage and root development."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Cherimoya trees benefit from annual pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches.", "Hand pollination can increase fruit set and yield, especially in indoor or non-native environments.", "Protect cherimoya trees from frost by using frost blankets or locating them near buildings.", "Mulching around the base of the tree helps retain soil moisture and regulate temperature."]
