    "name": "Cherry Plum",
    "climate": ["Cherry plum trees thrive best in temperate climates where they can experience a period of dormancy.", "They can tolerate a range of climates, but prefer regions with moderate and even temperatures without extreme cold or heat.", "A consistent climate with well-distributed rainfall throughout the year provides ideal growth conditions.", "In areas with harsh winters, cherry plum trees may require protection from frost to produce well."],
    "sunlight": ["Cherry plums require full sunlight for optimal fruit production, needing at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.", "While they prefer full sun, they can also tolerate partial shade if necessary, but this may reduce fruit yield.", "Maintaining at least a bright, well-lit spot ensures they can photosynthesize effectively for growth.", "In regions with intense sun and heat, providing some afternoon shade can prevent leaf scorch and stress."],
    "watering": ["Cherry plums need regular watering, especially during dry periods for healthy fruiting.", "Ensuring the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged is crucial for their root health.", "A drip irrigation system works effectively, as it delivers water directly to the root zone.", "Mulching around the base can help retain moisture and maintain a cooler root environment."],
    "soil": ["Cherry plum trees prefer a well-drained loamy soil that retains moisture without becoming waterlogged.", "They can adapt to various soil types but prefer soils rich in organic matter for nutrient supply.", "Soil pH should ideally be slightly acidic to neutral, around 6.0 to 7.0, for optimal growth.", "Ensuring good soil aeration and drainage helps prevent root diseases and promotes healthy growth."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pruning cherry plum trees in late winter helps maintain their shape and removes any dead or diseased branches.", "Applying a balanced fertilizer in early spring encourages healthy growth and fruit production.", "Regularly checking for pests and diseases can prevent infestations that might harm the tree.", "Thinning out excess fruit can improve size and quality of remaining fruits, enhancing overall yield."]
