    "name": "Cherry Tomato",
    "climate": ["Cherry tomatoes thrive best in warm climates where the temperature remains consistently between 70°F to 85°F.", "They can grow in cooler climates, but might require a longer period to mature and ample sunlight for optimal growth.", "In regions with harsh winters, cherry tomatoes can be cultivated as annuals, requiring protection from frost.", "Humidity levels should be moderate; excessively humid environments can lead to fungal diseases."],
    "sunlight": ["Cherry tomatoes require full sun exposure for at least 6 to 8 hours daily to fruit efficiently.", "Inadequate sunlight can lead to leggy growth and reduced fruit production, impacting the yield significantly.", "They can tolerate some shade but will perform best in locations where they receive maximum sunlight throughout the day.", "To ensure even growth, consider rotating pots or containers if grown indoors to provide light from all angles."],
    "watering": ["Consistent watering is crucial for cherry tomatoes; the soil should be kept moist but not waterlogged to prevent root rot.", "Deep watering once or twice a week is preferable to frequent shallow watering, helping the roots grow deeper.", "Inadequate watering can lead to issues like blossom end rot or splitting of the fruit, impacting the crop's quality.", "Early morning is the best time to water, allowing soil to dry before nightfall, reducing the risk of fungus."],
    "soil": ["Well-draining, fertile soil rich in organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure is ideal for cherry tomatoes.", "A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 promotes optimal nutrient absorption.", "Heavy clay soils, if not amended, can lead to poor drainage, so incorporating sand or perlite can help.", "Raised beds or containers with quality potting mix are good options for providing the ideal soil structure."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Providing support in the form of cages or stakes can help manage the plant's vining habit and promote air circulation.", "Pruning the lower leaves and suckers regularly encourages healthier growth and larger fruit production.", "Protecting the plants from insects like aphids or hornworms by using natural remedies or safe insecticides can be beneficial.", "Monitoring and maintaining a consistent feeding regimen with a balanced fertilizer helps improve overall plant vigor."]
