    "name": "Chicago Hardy Fig",
    "climate": ["This fig variety is well-suited to temperate climates, making it ideal for regions with moderate temperatures.", "Chicago Hardy Fig can survive in cooler climates as it has a good tolerance to lower temperatures.", "Adaptable to climates that have distinct seasonal changes, allowing it to thrive outdoors.", "It is capable of withstanding the cold winter months, which makes it suitable for certain northern regions."],
    "sunlight": ["Chicago Hardy Fig needs full sun exposure for optimal growth and fruit production.", "This plant thrives best when it receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day.", "Ensure the plant is placed in a location where it can soak up maximum sunlight throughout the day.", "Inadequate sunlight can lead to poor growth and reduced fruit yield for the Chicago Hardy Fig."],
    "watering": ["Chicago Hardy Fig requires consistent watering, especially during warmer months, to keep its soil moist.", "Overwatering should be avoided as it can lead to root rot; let the soil dry slightly between waterings.", "The plant benefits from deep, infrequent watering rather than shallow, frequent watering.", "During winter, when plant growth slows down, reduce watering frequency to prevent overwatering issues."],
    "soil": ["Well-draining soil is crucial for the Chicago Hardy Fig to prevent waterlogged conditions.", "The plant thrives in a fertile soil enriched with organic matter to support healthy growth.", "A sandy or loamy soil composition is preferred to ensure proper drainage and aeration.", "Soil pH should ideally be neutral to slightly alkaline for optimal nutrient absorption."],
    "toxic": ["The latex or sap from fig trees, including the Chicago Hardy Fig, can be irritating to skin.", "Ingestion of the sap or fruit by pets may lead to mild gastrointestinal distress.", "It's advisable to keep the plant away from curious pets and children to prevent any issues.", "Direct contact with the sap may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pruning should be done during the dormant season to encourage new growth in spring.", "Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.", "In extremely cold areas, consider winter protection methods to prevent damage.", "Avoid nitrogen-heavy fertilizers, which can promote excessive leafy growth over fruit development."]
