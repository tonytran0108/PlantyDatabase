    "name": "Chicken Gizzard",
    "climate": [
        "Chicken Gizzard, also known as Iresine herbstii, thrives in warm, humid conditions that mimic tropical environments. It prefers consistent temperatures that do not drop too low.",
        "This plant is best suited for areas that do not experience frost. If grown outdoors in non-tropical climates, it should be brought indoors when temperatures drop.",
        "It does well in USDA hardiness zones 10 and 11, where the climate is warm year-round. In cooler regions, it is typically grown as a houseplant.",
        "Ensure the plant is not subjected to cold drafts or sudden temperature changes, as these can stress the plant and hinder its growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Chicken Gizzard requires bright, indirect sunlight to maintain its vibrant foliage colors. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves.",
        "If grown indoors, place the plant near a window that gets filtered light or use sheer curtains to diffuse direct sunlight.",
        "Outdoor plants should be positioned in areas with dappled sunlight or partial shade, particularly in regions with intense sun.",
        "Insufficient light can cause the colors of the leaves to fade and impact the overall health of the plant."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, which can be detrimental to the plant's health. Ensure proper drainage.",
        "During the growing season, you may need to water more frequently, but reduce watering in the winter months.",
        "Monitor the plant's environment closely; higher humidity levels may require less frequent watering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining soil mix is best for the Chicken Gizzard, such as a standard potting mix enriched with perlite or sand.",
        "The addition of organic matter like peat moss or compost can help retain moisture while still allowing for proper drainage.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that hold excess water and do not drain properly, as these can lead to root issues.",
        "Regular repotting every couple of years with fresh soil will ensure the plant remains healthy and continues to grow well."

    "toxic": [], 
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning Chicken Gizzard regularly helps maintain a bushy, attractive appearance. Pinch back the tips to encourage branching.",
        "Monitor for common pests such as aphids or spider mites. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or natural predators."
