    "name": "Chickpea Plant",
    "climate": [
        "Chickpeas prefer a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters.",
        "These plants thrive in semi-arid climates with well-defined seasons.",
        "The vegetation period requires a moderate temperature and dry climate.",
        "Frost-free conditions are essential for chickpea cultivation success."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Chickpea plants require full sun to grow and produce efficiently.",
        "Ensure the plant gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor flowering and reduced yield.",
        "Adequate sunlight exposure is critical for healthy growth and pods."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Chickpeas need well-distributed moisture during early growth stages.",
        "Avoid overwatering; they require moderately dry conditions to thrive.",
        "Waterlogging or excess moisture can cause root rot in chickpeas.",
        "A balanced watering schedule helps maintain optimal soil moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Chickpeas grow well in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils.",
        "Soils should be fertile, deep, and have good water-holding capacity.",
        "Ensure soil pH is around 6.0 to 9.0 for optimal chickpea growth.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils; they restrict root growth and aeration."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Rotate crops annually to prevent disease and pest buildup in soil.",
        "Control weeds regularly as they compete with chickpeas for nutrients.",
        "Regularly monitor for pests like aphids, which can affect the crop.",
        "Use organic mulches to maintain soil moisture and suppress weeds."
