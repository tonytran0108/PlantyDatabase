        "Prefers a temperate climate zone with distinct seasons for optimal growth.",
        "Thrives well in areas that experience mild to moderate temperatures annually.",
        "Not suited for tropical climates; prefers cooler conditions over excessive heat.",
        "Best grown in regions where seasonal temperature variations are present."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Requires full sun exposure for at least six hours a day to bloom successfully.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but it may result in reduced flowering capacity.",
        "Direct sunlight encourages healthy growth and helps maintain vibrant blossoms.",
        "Shadier environments lead to leggy growth and fewer bright, attractive flowers."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential, especially during the first growing season to establish roots.",
        "Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but benefits from consistent moisture.",
        "Avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot; ensure well-draining soil is used.",
        "In hotter months, additional watering may be necessary to prevent dehydration."

    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter for optimal growth.",
        "Soil should maintain a balance of moisture without being overly wet or dry.",
        "Performs best in slightly acidic to neutral pH soil conditions for thriving health.",
        "Compacted or heavy clay soils should be amended to improve drainage and growth."
