    "climate": [
        "Chives thrive in temperate climates where they can enjoy a cool, moderate summer.",
        "They prefer environments with mild winters as they are relatively hardy plants.",
        "Chives can grow well in areas with significant seasonal temperature variations.",
        "While they prefer cooler climates, chives can tolerate some heat if well-watered."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Chives require full sun to grow optimally, needing at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but require sufficient sunlight to produce flavorful leaves.",
        "A sunny spot in the garden or on a windowsill will help their growth tremendously.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggy growth and reduced flavor in the leaves."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Chives need consistent moisture but should not be left in soggy soil, which can harm them.",
        "Water the plants thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry out.",
        "Ensure good drainage to prevent water from pooling around the roots and causing rot.",
        "In pots, chives may need more frequent watering compared to those in the ground."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Chives prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter and nutrients.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH is ideal, usually ranging from 6.0 to 7.0.",
        "Incorporate compost to improve the soil structure and moisture retention.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils unless they are amended significantly for better drainage."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly dividing chives every three to four years encourages vigorous growth and prevents overcrowding."
