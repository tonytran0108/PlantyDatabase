    "name": "Chocolate Cosmos",
    "climate": ["Chocolate Cosmos thrive in temperate climates and prefer mild weather conditions. They cannot withstand frost very well.", "These plants do well in an environment where there are significant temperature variations between day and night.", "The ideal climate for Chocolate Cosmos is similar to their native habitat in Mexico, with warm summers and cooler, dry winters.", "They are not suited for very humid or tropical climates as excessive moisture can lead to root rot."],
    "sunlight": ["Chocolate Cosmos require full sunlight for at least six hours a day to bloom brilliantly.", "Although they prefer full sun, some afternoon shade in particularly hot areas can help prevent heat stress.", "These plants can tolerate partial shade, but too much will result in fewer flowers and leggy growth.", "Consistent exposure to bright sunlight will ensure that Chocolate Cosmos maintain their rich color and robust stems."],
    "watering": ["Water Chocolate Cosmos sparingly but consistently, avoiding overwatering to prevent root damage.","These plants prefer to dry out between watering sessions; check the soil moisture regularly.","During the growing season, you may need to water them more frequently if the weather is particularly dry. ", "Be cautious of standing water, as Chocolate Cosmos are prone to root rot if the soil remains waterlogged for too long."],
    "soil": ["Chocolate Cosmos prefer well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging; sandy or loamy soil types work best.","Enriching the soil with organic matter like compost can enhance drainage and provide nutrients.","Ensure the soil has a neutral to slightly acidic pH level, which is ideal for their growth.","Avoid heavy clay soils as they retain too much water, making it difficult for the roots to breathe."],
    "toxic": ["The Chocolate Cosmos plant is non-toxic to pets and humans, making it a safe choice for gardens with animals."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Deadhead spent blooms regularly to encourage continuous flowering throughout the growing season.", "In colder climates, tubers can be dug up and stored indoors during the winter to protect them from frost."]
