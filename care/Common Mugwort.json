    "name": "Common Mugwort",
    "climate": ["Common Mugwort thrives in temperate climates, adapting well to moderate temperatures.", "This plant can withstand a variety of conditions but prefers cool, mild environments.", "Mugwort does well in areas with distinct seasons, including cold winters and warm summers.", "While it can endure harsh conditions, it grows best where seasonal changes are evident."],
    "sunlight": ["Mugwort requires full sun to partial shade to grow robustly and healthily.", "It can tolerate direct sunlight for several hours a day, benefiting from bright conditions.", "Partial sunlight exposure is also suitable, allowing for some relief during the hottest part of the day.", "Ensure the plant has access to ample sunlight; direct exposure promotes dense foliage growth."],
    "watering": ["Water Mugwort moderately; it is drought-tolerant but benefits from regular moisture.", "The plant prefers well-drained soil and does not thrive in overly wet conditions.", "Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.", "During dry spells, increase watering frequency to maintain healthy growth."],
    "soil": ["Common Mugwort thrives in well-draining soil with moderate fertility.", "Sandy or loamy soils are ideal, allowing for adequate drainage.", "It can tolerate nutrient-deficient soils but grows best with some organic matter.", "Mugwort is adaptable to varying soil types, though poor drainage should be avoided."],
    "toxic": ["While not highly toxic, Mugwort contains thujone, which can be harmful if ingested in large quantities.", "Consumption of parts of the plant may lead to allergic reactions or digestive issues.", "Caution should be taken as Mugwort can cause skin irritation upon contact in sensitive individuals.", "Animals and pets should avoid ingesting this plant due to potential toxicity symptoms."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Regular pruning can help maintain the shape and promote bushier growth.", "Monitor for invasive tendencies; Mugwort can spread aggressively if left unchecked.", "In frost-prone areas, protective mulching during winter can prevent root damage.", "Ensure the plant is not over-fertilized; too much nutrient can disrupt its natural growth cycle."]
