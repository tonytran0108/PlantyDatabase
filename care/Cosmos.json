        "Cosmos plants thrive in warm climates and enjoy full exposure to the sun.",
        "They perform best in climates that do not experience severe frost or cold.", 
        "These plants are well-suited to grow in regions with a warm temperate climate.", 
        "They flourish in summers that are sunny and not too wet overall."

    "sunlight": [
        "Cosmos flowers require full sunlight to grow and bloom effectively.", 
        "These plants perform well in locations that receive at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.",
        "They need bright, direct sunlight for best growth and flower production.",
        "Shade can hamper their growth, so full sun exposure is ideal for cosmos."

    "watering": [
        "Cosmos plants are drought-tolerant and prefer infrequent watering.", 
        "They require low water once established but need regular moisture at seedling stage.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; soil should dry between watering.",
        "A deep watering each week suffices, especially during prolonged dry spells."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Cosmos prefer poor to average soil; rich soil leads to more foliage than flowers.",
        "They thrive in well-draining, sandy soil that prevents waterlogging issues.",
        "Loamy or sandy texture is ideal for cosmos, promoting healthy root systems.",
        "These plants can tolerate various soil types but avoid overly fertile soils."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead regularly to encourage new blooms and prolong flowering season.", 
        "Staking may be necessary for taller varieties to prevent them from flopping.",
        "Fertilization is not needed and can result in excessive leafy growth over flowers."
