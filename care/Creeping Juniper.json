    "name": "Creeping Juniper",
    "climate": [
        "Creeping Juniper thrives in temperate climates where winters are not overly harsh.",
        "It can also be found in some subtropical climates, given proper care and conditions.",
        "This plant is quite adaptable and can tolerate a range of climate conditions.",
        "However, extreme cold or severe heat may stunt its growth or cause damage."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Creeping Juniper requires full sun for the best growth, ideally receiving 6-8 hours daily.",
        "It can survive in partial shade, but may not be as vibrant or healthy in such conditions.",
        "Direct, bright sunlight ensures vigorous growth and maintains its compact foliage.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggy growth and reduced overall plant health."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water regularly during the first growing season to establish a deep, extensive root system.",
        "Once established, Creeping Juniper is drought tolerant and requires less frequent watering.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; it's crucial to allow the soil to dry between waterings.",
        "In particularly dry periods, supplemental watering can support ongoing growth and vigor."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining soils and can tolerate poor soil conditions, including rocky or sandy.",
        "Soil with good aeration helps prevent waterlogging, a risk for root rot in wet conditions.",
        "Although it can adapt, acidic to neutral pH soil is ideal for Creeping Juniper growth.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils unless amended to improve drainage and root penetration."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune occasionally to maintain shape and prevent overgrowth, especially in landscape areas.",
        "Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth."
