    "watering": [
        "Regular watering during the first few years after planting is crucial to establish a strong root system.",
        "Once established, it should be watered deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth and drought tolerance.",
        "Avoid waterlogging by ensuring the soil has adequate drainage, preventing root rot and other water-related diseases.",
        "In periods of extreme drought or heat, additional watering may be necessary to support overall health and vitality."

    "soil": [
        "Thrives in well-draining soils that provide ample nutrients and aeration for optimal growth.",
        "While adaptable to various soil types, it prefers slightly acidic to neutral pH levels for optimal health.",
        "Can manage in less-than-ideal soils, including clay and sandy soils, as long as drainage is adequate.",

        "Mulching around the base aids moisture retention, suppresses weeds, and regulates soil temperature effectively.",
        "Regularly check for signs of fungal diseases, especially in humid areas, and treat as needed to protect health."
