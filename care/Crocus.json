    "name": "Crocus",
    "climate": [
        "Crocus plants thrive in temperate climates with cool winters.",
        "They can tolerate frost and are often found in alpine areas.",
        "Crocus prefers regions with moderate rainfall throughout the year.",
        "They are not well-suited to tropical or extreme arid environments."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Crocus plants need full sun to partial shade to bloom effectively.",
        "They benefit from the morning sun but should be shielded from harsh afternoon rays.",
        "During the blooming period, sunlight exposure enhances flowering.",
        "In dormant seasons, sunlight is less critical but still beneficial."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Crocus requires moderate watering; avoid waterlogging the soil.",
        "During active growth, water when the topsoil feels dry to touch.",
        "In dormant summer months, reduce watering to prevent bulb rot.",
        "Ensure the soil is well-drained to support bulb health and growth."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Crocus grows best in well-drained sandy or loamy soil types.",
        "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral for optimal growth.",
        "Add organic matter to improve soil fertility and drainage capacity.",
        "Avoid clay-heavy soils as they retain moisture and may rot bulbs."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Crocus plants are toxic if ingested, causing gastrointestinal distress."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Plant crocus bulbs in the fall before the ground freezes.",
        "Protect from rodents that may dig up and eat the bulbs.",
        "Divide overcrowded clumps after blooming to prevent over-competition.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and deter weed growth."
