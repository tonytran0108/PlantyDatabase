    "sunlight": [
        "Cryptanthus thrives in bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light levels.",
        "Avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the leaves of Cryptanthus plants.",
        "In indoor settings, placing them near windows with filtered sunlight is ideal.",
        "Artificial grow lights can supplement lighting in areas lacking natural light."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Cryptanthus regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "During growing months, increase watering frequency to support their development.",
        "Ensure proper drainage to avoid root rot, a common issue with overwatering.",
        "Reduce watering in winter months, allowing the soil to dry out more between waterings."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Cryptanthus thrives in well-aerated, fast-draining soil mixes tailored for bromeliads.",
        "A mixture incorporating orchid bark and sphagnum moss can enhance its growth.",
        "Avoid heavy soils that retain too much moisture, which can harm the roots.",
        "The soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, mimicking native growth conditions."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Cryptanthus plants benefit from occasional misting to increase humidity around them.",
        "Fertilize lightly during the growing season with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.",
        "Regularly remove dead or damaged leaves to maintain plant health and aesthetics.",
        "Consider a shallow pot to accommodate their wide, shallow root system effectively."
