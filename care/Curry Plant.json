    "name": "Curry Plant",
    "climate": ["Curry plant thrives in warm and dry climates, reminiscent of Mediterranean weather.", "It can tolerate a range of temperatures but prefers milder conditions without extreme cold.", "High humidity levels are not ideal for the curry plant, as it prefers less moisture in the air.", "The plant does best in zones where the temperature is generally steady without severe fluctuations."],
    "sunlight": ["Full sunlight is essential for optimal growth of the curry plant to maintain its aromatic quality.", "A location with at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily is ideal for this plant.", "Without adequate sunlight, the curry plant may become leggy and not thrive as expected.", "Curry plants adapt well in bright outdoor settings where they receive unfiltered sunlight."],
    "watering": ["Curry plants prefer dry conditions and do not require frequent watering to thrive.", "Over-watering can lead to root rot, so it is crucial to allow the soil to dry between waterings.", "During hotter months, increase watering slightly, ensuring the top inch of soil is dry before watering again.", "In the dormant winter months, reduce watering to prevent moisture accumulation in the soil."],
    "soil": ["Well-drained soil is crucial for the health of a curry plant, preventing waterlogged roots.", "Sandy or loamy soils are excellent, as they allow proper drainage and air circulation at the roots.", "A neutral or slightly alkaline soil pH enhances the nutrient absorption for better plant health.", "Improving soil with organic matter or compost can help retain necessary nutrients without excess moisture."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["To maintain a compact shape and promote growth, prune the curry plant regularly, especially after flowering.", "Avoid drastic changes in environmental conditions, as curry plants can be sensitive to sudden temperature drops.", "Fertilize sparingly as excess nutrients might damage the bases of the stems; an all-purpose fertilizer once during the growing season is usually sufficient.", "Watch for pests like spider mites or aphids; natural remedies or gentle insecticidal soaps can keep infestations at bay."]
