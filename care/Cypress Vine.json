    "climate": [
        "Cypress Vine thrives in warm climates and is best suited for tropical or subtropical regions.",
        "This plant prefers climates that have a distinct warm and humid environment during the growing season.",
        "It grows well in areas with long, hot summers and mild winters, making it ideal for those conditions.",
        "To ensure healthy growth, Cypress Vine should be in regions where frost is minimal or nonexistent."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Cypress Vine requires full sun for most of the day to thrive and produce abundant flowers.",
        "It needs at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight to ensure vigorous growth and blooming.",
        "The plant can withstand some light shade, but full exposure to the sun is ideal for best results.",
