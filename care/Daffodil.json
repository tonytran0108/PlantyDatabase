        "Hot, arid climates are generally unsuitable for daffodil growth.",
        "Ideal growing conditions include cool, moist springs and warm summers."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Daffodils require full sun for optimum flower production and growth.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but may produce fewer blooms as a result.",

        "Daffodils require consistent watering during their growing season in spring.",
        "Allow the soil to dry out slightly between watering to avoid bulb rot.",
        "During dormancy in summer, reduce watering significantly to a bare minimum.",
        "Well-drained soil helps to prevent overwatering and subsequent root issues."

    "soil": [
        "Daffodils require well-draining soil enriched with organic matter for growth.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, around 6.0 to 7.0, is ideal for daffodils.",
        "Heavy clay soils need amendment to improve drainage and aeration.",
        "Sandy loam with good water retention supports healthy daffodil growth."
