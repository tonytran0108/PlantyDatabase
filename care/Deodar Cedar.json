        "The Deodar Cedar thrives in temperate regions with mild winters and hot summers.",
        "It can tolerate lower temperatures but grows best in areas without extreme cold.",
        "High humidity or excessively wet regions are not ideal for Deodar Cedars.",
        "They prefer climates where they can receive consistent sunlight throughout the year."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Deodar Cedars require full sun exposure to grow healthy and robust.",
        "A minimum of six hours of direct sunlight per day is recommended for optimal growth.",
        "They may survive in partial shade but will not be as vigorous or healthy.",

    "watering": [
        "Young Deodar Cedars require regular watering to establish their root systems.",
        "Once established, they are relatively drought-tolerant but benefit from occasional deep watering.",
        "It is crucial to avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot and other health issues.",
        "During dry periods, ensure soil does not dry out completely between watering sessions."

    "soil": [
        "Deodar Cedars prefer well-draining soils to prevent waterlogged roots.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral soil is ideal, with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 being optimal.",
        "Soil enriched with organic matter can provide additional nutrients for growth.",
        "They can adapt to various soil types but will not thrive in heavy clay or compacted soils."
