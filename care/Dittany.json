    "name": "Dittany",
    "climate": [
        "Dittany thrives best in Mediterranean climates and prefers warm, dry conditions.",
        "It grows well in areas with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers typical of its native habitat.",
        "The plant is adapted to regions where temperatures rarely drop below freezing, providing a temperate environment.",
        "High humidity or overly wet climates may not be suitable for its optimal growth, leading to issues."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Dittany requires full sun exposure to thrive and produce its characteristic aromatic qualities.",
        "This plant prefers at least six hours of direct sunlight daily, benefiting from bright light.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but full sun encourages optimal growth and flower production.",
        "Avoid full shade locations, as lacking sunlight can lead to leggy growth and reduced vigor."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water dittany sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided, as the plant prefers dry conditions similar to its natural habitat.",
        "During dry spells, occasional deep watering can help maintain health without saturating the roots.",
        "In Mediterranean climates, it thrives with low water requirements, reducing maintenance needs."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Dittany grows best in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils that mimic its native rocky hillsides.",
        "A fast-draining soil mix is essential to prevent waterlogging, which can harm the roots.",
        "Additions of gravel or coarse sand to soil can improve drainage and mimic natural conditions.",
        "Ensure the soil is low in organic material to match the poor, nutrient-sparse Mediterranean soils."
