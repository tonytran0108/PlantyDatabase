    "name": "Duckweed",
    "climate": [
        "Duckweed thrives in temperate climates where temperatures are mild.",
        "It can also grow well in tropical climates with warm temperatures.",
        "In cooler climates, growth slows down during the colder months.",
        "Extreme cold can damage or kill duckweed; it prefers warmer waters."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Duckweed requires full sunlight to partial shade for optimal growth.",
        "It grows best in areas where it receives at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.",
        "Partial shade is also acceptable, but growth may be slower.",
        "Too much direct sunlight without sufficient water can harm the plant."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Duckweed grows in water, so it requires consistently moist conditions.",
        "It is an aquatic plant, thus it thrives with constant submersion.",
        "The water should be nutrient-rich to support healthy growth.",
        "Stagnant water with little disturbance is ideal for duckweed propagation."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Soil is not needed as duckweed floats on water surfaces without rooting.",
        "If grown in containers, a small amount of aquatic plant soil can be used.",
        "Nutrient content in the water offsets the lack of traditional soil.",
        "Water with decomposed organic matter enhances nutrient availability."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Duckweed is generally non-toxic, but decomposition can foul water quality."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular monitoring is important to prevent duckweed from choking water surfaces."
