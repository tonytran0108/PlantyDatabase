    "sunlight": [
        "Thrives in locations that offer full sun exposure for most of the day.",

        "Requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot due to poor drainage capabilities.",
        "Drought tolerant once established, but prefers consistent moisture levels.",
        "Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth and stability."

    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-drained, sandy soil types that prevent waterlogging issues.",
        "Can adapt to a range of soils but thrives best in slightly acidic conditions.",
        "Soil should be nutrient-rich to support healthy foliage and growth habits.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils as they retain water and can damage root systems."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune regularly to maintain shape and promote denser foliage growth.",
        "Remove spent flowers or damaged leaves to prevent disease and pests.",
        "Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring to boost growth.",
        "Consider mulching around the base to maintain soil moisture and temperature."
