    "name": "Dwarf Flowering Almond",
    "climate": ["The Dwarf Flowering Almond prefers temperate climates where it can thrive outdoors. It can tolerate colder climates during winter but needs protection from extended frosts.", "It is suited to regions with distinct seasonal changes, including cold winters and warm summers, allowing for successful flowering in spring.", "This plant benefits from a climate with adequate rainfall patterns throughout the year, preventing the soil from drying out excessively.", "Humidity levels should not be too extreme; moderate environmental humidity aids in its optimal growth throughout its life cycle."],
    "sunlight": ["The Dwarf Flowering Almond thrives in full sun, requiring at least six hours of direct light daily. However, it should be protected from intense afternoon sun in extremely hot regions.", "While full sunlight is ideal, this plant can tolerate partial shade, particularly in areas with scorching sunlight; it will still bloom, albeit potentially less vigorously.", "Positioning the plant where it receives strong morning light can help simulate the dappled sun conditions of its native habitats, ensuring balanced growth.", "The plant should not be kept in complete shade as this will hinder flowering and lead to poorer overall health, decreasing its ornamental value."],
    "watering": ["Consistent watering is crucial for the Dwarf Flowering Almond, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Excess drying should be avoided.", "In spring and summer, increase watering to support the flowering phase, ensuring the plant receives adequate moisture to sustain blooms.", "During autumn and winter, reduce watering frequency, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.", "A well-draining water system is essential to avoid standing water around the roots, which can increase susceptibility to fungal infections."],
    "soil": ["The Dwarf Flowering Almond prefers well-drained, sandy loam to clay soils, ensuring the soil retains enough moisture without becoming waterlogged.", "Soil should be rich in organic matter, providing nutrients that support robust growth and vibrant flowering, enhancing the overall plant vitality.", "Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is ideal, promoting optimal nutrient uptake and aiding in the plant's resilience against potential disease threats.", "Regular soil amendments, such as compost, encourage healthy root development and flower production by improving soil structure and fertility."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Prune following flowering to maintain shape and encourage denser branching, which results in more flowering shoots in subsequent seasons.", "Protection from strong winds is beneficial as it prevents potential damage to delicate blossoms and ensures a longer blooming period."]
