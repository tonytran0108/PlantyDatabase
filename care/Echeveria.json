    "name": "Echeveria",
    "climate": [
        "Echeveria thrives in warm, arid climates similar to those of desert regions.",
        "These plants do well in a climate with temperature ranges of 20°C to 30°C.",
        "They are not frost-tolerant and prefer environments with low humidity.",
        "Echeverias are suited for hardiness zones 9 to 11, needing a dry climate."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Echeveria plants require at least six hours of bright, indirect sunlight per day.",
        "Direct sunlight can be tolerated in mild regions, preferably during the morning.",
        "Too much direct sunlight in hot climates can scorch the leaves, causing damage.",
        "If grown indoors, they benefit from being near a south-facing window for light."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Echeveria needs the 'soak and dry' method of watering to prevent root rot.",
        "Water thoroughly but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.",
        "During the growing season of spring and summer, water more frequently as needed.",
        "Reduce watering significantly in the winter to mimic their natural dormant period."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Echeveria requires well-draining soil to ensure their roots do not sit in water.",
        "A cactus or succulent potting mix is ideal, often containing sand or perlite.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, with values between 6.0 and 7.0.",
        "Enhancing the soil with inorganic materials like pumice can improve aeration."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Echeveria should be protected from frost and extreme temperature fluctuations.",
        "Regularly clean their leaves to remove any dust, preventing pests and diseases.",
        "If leaves drop or become leggy, it's a sign of inadequate light; adjust conditions.",
        "Re-pot every two years in spring to provide fresh soil and room for growth."
