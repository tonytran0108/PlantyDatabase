    "name": "English Walnut",
    "climate": [
        "English Walnut trees thrive in temperate climates with cold winters.",
        "They require a climate with a significant winter chill for dormancy.",
        "This plant is frost-resistant and needs seasonal temperature variation.",
        "It grows best in regions with mild, humid summers and cold winters."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "English Walnuts need full sunlight for optimal growth and nut production.",
        "They require at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "Planting in a location with unobstructed sunlight maximizes nut yield.",
        "Partial shade can reduce productivity and hinder tree development."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is crucial during the first few years of growth.",
        "Deep watering helps establish a strong root system for young trees.",
        "Mature trees are more drought-tolerant but still benefit from watering during dry spells.",
        "Consistent soil moisture is important, especially in hot, dry seasons."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "English Walnuts prefer deep, fertile, well-drained soil with good fertility.",
        "Loamy soils with neutral to slightly acidic pH levels are ideal.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils, which can lead to poor drainage and root issues.",
        "Amending soil with organic matter improves nutrient availability and structure."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "English Walnut trees contain juglone, a compound toxic to some plant species.",
        "The leaves, roots, and husks release juglone, inhibiting nearby plant growth."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune English Walnut trees in late winter or early spring for structure.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain moisture and suppress weeds."
