    "name": "Estragon",
    "climate": [
        "Estragon thrives in temperate climates with moderate seasonal changes.",
        "It prefers regions with warm summers and mild winters.",
        "The plant is tolerant of arid and semi-arid conditions too.",
        "Suitable for USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8 for optimal growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun exposure is ideal for the optimal growth of estragon.",
        "It requires at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "In very hot areas, some afternoon shade can be beneficial.",
        "Lack of sufficient sunlight can lead to leggy and weak plant growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Estragon prefers evenly moist soil, especially in dry periods.",
        "It doesn't tolerate waterlogged conditions and needs good drainage.",
        "Water sparingly to prevent root rot, particularly in cooler climates.",
        "Soil should be allowed to slightly dry out between waterings."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Estragon thrives best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.",
        "The soil must be nutrient-rich to support healthy growth and vigor.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels between 6.5 and 7.5 are ideal.",
        "It can tolerate poorer soils, but will require regular fertilization."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning helps promote bushy growth and prevents legginess.",
        "Mulching around the base can help retain moisture in the soil.",
        "Estragon can spread vigorously, so containment may be necessary.",
        "In colder zones, protect the plant during harsh winter months."
