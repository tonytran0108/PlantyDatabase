    "name": "False Holly",
    "climate": ["False Holly thrives best in temperate climates where the temperatures are mild.", "Avoid extreme temperature shifts to keep this plant healthy, as it can be sensitive to sudden changes.", "It requires a climate with a decent level of humidity, as overly dry environments may affect its growth negatively.", "False Holly can tolerate a range of climates, but it grows best when sheltered from harsh climatic conditions."],
    "sunlight": ["False Holly prefers partial shade to partial sun, which mimics its natural woodland habitat.", "Direct, harsh sunlight can scorch the leaves, so it is best to provide filtered or indirect light.", "The plant can tolerate shadier conditions, though it may lead to less dense foliage.", "Opt for a spot that gets morning sun and afternoon shade to provide optimal growing conditions."],
    "watering": ["This plant prefers consistently moist soil but not waterlogged, so regular watering is essential.", "Allowing the top inch of the soil to dry out between waterings will prevent overwatering problems.", "Increase the frequency of watering during the hotter months to ensure the plant remains hydrated.", "Reduce watering during the winter months when the plant's growth slows and it requires less water."],
    "soil": ["False Holly grows well in well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter for nutrients.", "Ensure the soil retains some moisture without becoming waterlogged by using a balanced soil mix.", "A slightly acidic to neutral pH level is optimal for the healthiest foliage and root development.", "Amend the soil with compost or peat moss to improve drainage and nutrient content, especially in clay soils."],
    "toxic": ["The False Holly is generally considered non-toxic, meaning it is safe around pets and children."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Prune regularly to maintain its shape and encourage bushy growth, removing any dead or damaged branches."]
