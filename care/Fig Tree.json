    "name": "Fig Tree",
    "climate": [
        "Fig trees thrive in a warm temperate climate with a dry season during maturation.",
        "They prefer regions with a minimum winter temperature above 15°F (-9°C) to avoid frost damage.",
        "In subtropical climates, they can grow with adequate irrigation during dry periods.",
        "Humid climates can support fig growth if the soil drains well to prevent root rot."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Fig trees require full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day to produce abundant fruit.",
        "They are sun-loving plants and may experience reduced yields in shady conditions.",
        "Ensure they are planted in a location that receives unrestricted sunlight for optimal growth.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but direct sunlight promotes better fruit production."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "During the growing season, fig trees need consistent watering to maintain moisture.",
        "They require deep watering once or twice a week; avoid frequent shallow watering.",
        "Reduce watering in fall and winter to allow the tree to enter dormancy and rest.",
        "Avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot; ensure soil has good drainage properties."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefer well-drained soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH level between 6.0 and 7.5.",
        "Loamy soil types that retain moisture but allow excess water to drain away are ideal.",
        "Improve heavy or clay soils with organic matter to facilitate better drainage and aeration.",
        "Container-grown figs require a high-quality potting mix fortified with perlite or vermiculite."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune fig trees in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth.",
        "Mulch around the base to conserve moisture and suppress weed growth.",
        "Protect from freezing temperatures by wrapping the trunk or moving indoor."
