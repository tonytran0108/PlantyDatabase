    "name": "Floribunda Rose",
    "climate": [
        "Floribunda roses thrive in climates with well-defined seasons, as they need a cold dormant period for proper blooming.",
        "These roses do best in temperate climates where they can experience a distinct winter and summer, aiding their growth cycles.",
        "Regions with mild winters and warm, not excessively hot, summers are ideal for floribunda roses to flourish.",
        "Avoid areas with harshly severe winters or overly humid and wet climates as they can negatively impact the plant's health."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Floribunda roses require a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth and blooming.",
        "When choosing a planting site, ensure the roses are in a location that receives uninterrupted sunlight throughout the day.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but it may result in fewer blooms and less vigorous growth for floribunda roses.",
        "Avoid deep shade as it can lead to weak growth, reduced flowering, and increased susceptibility to diseases."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is necessary, particularly during dry spells, to maintain soil moisture for floribunda roses.",
        "It is crucial to water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage, which can foster diseases.",
        "Floribunda roses prefer deep, infrequent watering rather than frequent shallow watering to encourage deep root growth.",
        "Be cautious not to overwater, as waterlogged soil can lead to root rot, negatively impacting plant health."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Floribunda roses thrive in well-drained soil rich in organic matter to support healthy growth and blooming.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH of about 6.0 to 6.8 is ideal for these roses to properly absorb nutrients.",
        "Amend heavy clay soils with compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and soil structure for root health.",
        "Avoid planting in overly sandy or nutrient-poor soils unless enriched with sufficient organic matter or fertilizer."
    ],
    "toxic": ["Floribunda roses are considered non-toxic to humans and pets, making them safe to grow in gardens accessible to children and animals."],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning helps promote vigorous growth and continuous blooming throughout the flowering season.",
        "Monitor for common rose pests like aphids and spider mites, using appropriate treatments if necessary.",
        "Apply mulch around the base to retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and provide a gradual supply of nutrients.",
        "Winter protection may be necessary in colder climates, such as applying mulch or covering with burlap to prevent damage."
