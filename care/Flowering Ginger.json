    "name": "Flowering Ginger",
    "climate": ["Flowering Ginger plants thrive in tropical climates, requiring high humidity and warm temperatures to grow.", "In non-tropical regions, these plants can be grown indoors where conditions can be controlled for optimal growth.", "They are not frost-tolerant, and exposure to temperatures below freezing can damage or kill the plant.", "Ideally, flowering ginger should be grown in USDA zones 9 through 11 for best cultivation."],
    "sunlight": ["Flowering Ginger plants prefer bright, indirect sunlight and should be protected from the harsh result of full midday sun.", "Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so partial shade during intense sun periods is beneficial.", "In indoor settings, placing the plant near a north or east-facing window is a good option.", "During the growing season, providing morning sun and afternoon shade can help the plant thrive."],
    "watering": ["These plants require consistent moisture, especially during their growing season, without allowing the soil to become waterlogged.", "A well-draining potting mix can help prevent root rot, a common issue with excessive watering.", "During the dormant winter months, watering frequency should be reduced substantially to mimic natural conditions.", "Ensure that the topsoil dries out slightly between waterings to prevent over-saturation and health issues."],
    "soil": ["Flowering Ginger prospers in loose, fertile soil that provides good drainage to prevent water retention issues.", "The soil should be rich in organic matter, such as compost or peat, to replicate the plant's natural habitat.", "Amending soil with sand or perlite can improve drainage, an essential feature for healthy root development.", "The optimal soil pH for Flowering Ginger cultivation is slightly acidic, usually in the range of 6.0 to 6.5."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Flowering Ginger may benefit from regular fertilization during its active growing season for optimal blooms.", "Pruning dead or damaged leaves can improve appearance and redirect energy to producing flowers.", "During colder months, consider using a humidity tray if grown indoors to maintain adequate humidity levels.", "Inspect regularly for pests like spider mites and aphids, common in indoor environments, and treat promptly."]
