    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun is ideal for Foxtail Palms, as they love getting plenty of direct sunlight throughout the day.",
        "While they can tolerate partial shade, insufficient sunlight may result in slower growth and less vibrant foliage.",

        "Overwatering can be harmful, potentially leading to root rot, so ensure good drainage.",
        "In winter, reduce watering frequency as the palm will grow slower and require less moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is crucial for Foxtail Palms to prevent waterlogged roots which can cause rot.",
        "A sandy, loamy mix enriched with organic matter benefits the overall health of the palm.",
