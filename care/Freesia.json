    "name": "Freesia",
    "climate": [
        "Freesias thrive in subtropical climates where temperatures are moderate.",
        "They require a climate that offers a distinct dry and cool period to bloom.",
        "These flowers prefer climates with mild winters and not too harsh summers.",
        "Freesias are well-suited for temperate regions with some seasonal variation."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Freesias need plenty of sunlight but should be sheltered from harsh, direct afternoon sun.",
        "They benefit from a spot that provides full sun in the morning and some shade later.",
        "These plants would thrive in bright, indirect sunlight to prevent sunburn.",
        "Avoid placing them in completely shaded areas as they need light for blooming."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "During the growth period, keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "Water them sparingly during dormant periods, reducing moisture intake.",
        "Do not allow the soil to dry out completely during the blooming phase.",
        "Overwatering freesias can lead to bulb rot, so balance moisture carefully."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Freesias prefer well-draining soil that mimics natural sandy substrates.",
        "They do well in a soil mix that contains compost for added nutrients.",
        "Aerated soil with good fertility is crucial for healthy freesia growth.",
        "Potting soil with added pearlite or grit can enhance drainage properties."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Freesias are generally considered non-toxic to humans and most pets."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Ensure to stake taller freesia varieties to support their growth.",
        "Protect freesias from frost by growing them in pots that can be moved.",
        "Deadhead spent blooms to encourage prolonged flowering and health.",
        "Consider lifting and storing bulbs in colder climates during winter."
