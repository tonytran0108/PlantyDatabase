        "This plant prefers climates where the summers are mild and not excessively hot.",
        "It does well in areas with a well-defined winter season, which helps it to enter dormancy.",
        "Phlox can tolerate some variations but grows optimally in a stable, temperate climate."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Garden Phlox thrives in full sunlight for most of the day to produce vibrant flowers.",
        "It can also tolerate partial shade but the blooming may be less profuse under shaded conditions.",
        "Ideally, it should receive at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth.",
        "In extremely hot climates, some afternoon shade can be beneficial to prevent wilting."

    "watering": [
        "Water Garden Phlox regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist during its growing season.",
        "Avoid waterlogging; well-draining soil is crucial to prevent root rot from excess moisture.",
        "During dry spells, you may need to increase watering frequency to maintain adequate moisture.",
        "Reduce watering in the winter period when the plant is dormant and growth slows down."

    "soil": [
        "Plant Garden Phlox in rich, well-drained soil with high organic matter content for best results.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is ideal, providing optimal conditions for nutrient uptake.",
