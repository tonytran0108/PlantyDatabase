    "name": "Garlic",
    "climate": [
        "Garlic thrives in a temperate climate with warm summers yet mild winters.",
        "It can tolerate some frost but performs best in conditions without extremes.",
        "Long growing seasons are ideal for garlic to mature and develop fully.",
        "Humidity levels are best kept low to prevent fungal diseases and rot."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Garlic requires full sun, which means at least six hours of direct sunlight.",
        "It can manage with partial sun but will not yield as robust of a harvest.",
        "Exposure to good sunlight helps bulbs develop their size and flavor well.",
        "In regions with less sunlight, additional artificial light could be beneficial."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Garlic needs moderate watering, especially important during the growth stage.",
        "Overwatering can lead to bulb rot, so ensure soil is well-draining.",
        "Reducing water during the latter stages helps prepare the bulbs for harvest.",
        "Water deeply but infrequently to encourage healthy root system development."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter is suitable for garlic.",
        "A soil pH of between 6.0 and 7.0 is generally recommended for optimal growth.",
        "Loamy soil that can retain necessary moisture yet drains efficiently is best.",
        "Heavy, clayey soils should be amended with sand and compost to improve drainage."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Remove any flowers that appear to direct energy back to bulb development.",
        "Mulching can help retain moisture and suppress weed growth around plants."
