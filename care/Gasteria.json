    "name": "Gasteria",
    "climate": [
        "Gasteria plants thrive in a dry, arid climate where rainfall is infrequent.",
        "They are native to South Africa and accustomed to warm, desert-like conditions.",
        "The ideal climate for Gasteria involves minimal humidity and high temperatures.",
        "While they can tolerate cooler temperatures, they prefer warmth and dryness."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Gasteria plants prefer bright, indirect sunlight and can suffer in direct sun.",
        "Too much direct sunlight can scorch their leaves, turning them white or brown.",
        "They grow best in shaded locations with filtered sunlight throughout the day.",
        "If grown indoors, a north or east-facing window provides optimum light exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Gasteria sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between watering sessions.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to maintain a dry environment.",
        "During the growing season, water every couple of weeks or when soil is completely dry.",
        "In winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant's water needs decrease significantly."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Gasteria requires well-draining soil, similar to a cactus or succulent mix.",
        "A mix containing sand, perlite, or pumice enhances drainage and prevents waterlogging.",
        "The soil should replicate their natural, rocky habitat for optimal growth.",
        "Adding organic matter is not necessary; the focus should be on drainage efficiency."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Gasteria is generally considered non-toxic to humans and pets.",
        "Although not highly toxic, ingestion may cause mild stomach upset in pets.",
        "Contact with the plant is unlikely to cause skin irritation or other symptoms.",
        "As with many plants, it's best to prevent pets from chewing it to be safe."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Ensure Gasteria receives airflow to avoid fungal issues on the leaves.",
        "Periodically clean dust off the leaves to allow for better photosynthesis.",
        "Repotting every few years with fresh soil can help maintain plant health.",
        "Watch for mealybugs and treat with insecticidal soap for early infestations."
