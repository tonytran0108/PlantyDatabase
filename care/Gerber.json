    "name": "Gerber",
    "climate": [
        "Gerber daisies thrive in a climate with mild, non-freezing temperatures.",
        "They prefer environments where the humidity is relatively moderate.",
        "These plants are sensitive to frost and require protection in cold climates.",
        "A climate with consistent temperatures between 60-75°F is ideal for growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Gerber daisies need full sun exposure for optimal blooming.",
        "At least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily ensures healthy flower production.",
        "In very hot climates, some afternoon shade can prevent leaf scorch.",
        "Bright, indirect sunlight can also be beneficial for these plants indoors."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water gerber daisies regularly to keep the soil consistently moist.",
        "Avoid overly dry soil as it can lead to wilting and reduced blooms.",
        "Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot from waterlogging.",
        "Water at the base to keep foliage dry, reducing fungal disease likelihood."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is crucial for preventing root rot in gerber daisies.",
        "A mix that includes sand, perlite, or vermiculite enhances drainage.",
        "Rich, organic matter like compost also improves soil fertility and texture.",
        "Neutral to slightly acidic soil pH between 6.0-6.5 is best for nutrient uptake."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Gerber daisies are generally non-toxic to humans and pets."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead spent blooms regularly to encourage continuous flowering.",
        "Watch for pests like aphids or whiteflies and treat them promptly.",
        "Avoid wetting the foliage when watering to reduce fungal diseases.",
        "Fertilize every 2-3 weeks during the growing season for robust growth."
