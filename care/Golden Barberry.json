    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Golden Barberry requires full sun to partial shade to display its best vibrant foliage colors.",
        "While full sun is preferred for optimum growth and color intensity, it can tolerate some shade periodically.",

    "watering": [
        "Water the Golden Barberry regularly during its first growing season to establish a deep, extensive root system.",

        "During periods of extended drought, provide supplemental watering to maintain plant health and vibrancy.",
        "In general, Golden Barberry prefers well-drained soil and does not like to sit in water for prolonged periods."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Golden Barberry thrives in well-draining soil that prevents water from pooling around its roots, reducing rot risk.",
        "It can tolerate a range of soil pH levels but prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil for optimal growth.",
        "Heavy clay soil should be amended with organic matter to improve drainage and structure, supporting healthy root development.",
        "This plant is adaptable and can grow in poor soil conditions, though enriched soil will enhance its vigor and color."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Golden Barberry contains berberine, an alkaloid that can be toxic if ingested by pets or humans.",
        "Ingesting parts of the plant may cause gastrointestinal distress, including vomiting and diarrhea in animals."
