        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage and dry periods.",
        "In winter, the cactus needs significantly less water due to cooler temperatures.",
        "Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the roots."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Needs well-draining soil, ideally a cactus or succulent mix for optimal growth.",
        "Soil should be sandy or gravelly to imitate natural desert conditions.",
        "Avoid using rich, dense potting soil as it retains too much moisture for cacti.",
