    "climate": [
        "Goldfish Plants thrive in warm, humid environments similar to tropical regions.",
        "They prefer temperatures between 65°F to 75°F and do not tolerate cold well.",
        "Avoid exposing to temperatures below 60°F as it may damage the plant.",
        "High humidity levels between 50% to 60% are ideal for these tropical plants."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Goldfish Plants require bright, indirect light to bloom well.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so filtered light is preferred.",
        "Consider placing them near east or west-facing windows for optimal light.",
        "Insufficient light can result in leggy growth and reduced flowering."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Goldfish Plants thoroughly, allowing the topsoil to dry between waterings.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; ensure the pot drains well.",
        "During active growth, they require more frequent watering than in winter.",
        "Reduce watering in cooler months but maintain enough to keep the soil moist."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Use well-draining potting soil rich in organic matter for Goldfish Plants.",
        "A mix of peat, perlite, and vermiculite ensures good aeration and drainage.",
        "Avoid heavy, compacted soils that may retain excess moisture.",
        "Repot every couple of years to refresh soil and prevent root bound issues."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly prune to maintain desired shape and encourage bushier growth.",
        "Misting can help increase humidity but avoid soaking the flowers.",
        "Fertilize with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during growing seasons.",
        "Check regularly for pests like aphids and mealybugs, and address promptly."
