    "name": "Grass Lily",
    "climate": ["Grass Lily, also known as Chlorophytum comosum, thrives in a warm climate with mild temperatures.","This plant prefers a temperate climate with no extremes in temperature, providing a comfortable growing environment.","It can adapt to varying humidity levels, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor settings.","Grass Lily plants do well in USDA hardiness zones 9 to 11, where the climate is suitable."],
    "sunlight": ["The Grass Lily prefers bright, indirect sunlight but can tolerate low light conditions for shorter periods.","Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so it's best to keep it away from harsh afternoon sun.","For optimal growth, place in a spot that receives filtered sunlight or partial shade.","Artificial grow lights can also be used as a supplemental light source indoors."],
    "watering": ["Water the plant thoroughly, but ensure the soil dries out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.","Avoid leaving the plant sitting in water, as consistent overwatering can cause health issues.","In general, water the Grass Lily once a week, adjusting frequency based on humidity and season.","During the winter months, reduce watering frequency, allowing the plant to rest."],
    "soil": ["Grass Lily thrives in a well-draining potting mix rich in organic matter for healthy growth.","The soil should retain some moisture but not remain overly wet, which can lead to rot.","A general-purpose indoor potting mix with added perlite can enhance drainage.","Ensure the soil pH is slightly acidic to neutral, ranging from about 6.0 to 7.0."],
    "toxic": ["Grass Lilies are non-toxic to humans and pets, making them a safe option for homes with animals."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Prune dead or yellowing leaves to maintain the plant's appearance and encourage growth."]
