    "name": "Hedgehog Cactus",
    "climate": [
        "The hedgehog cactus thrives in hot and arid climates, typical of desert environments.",
        "These cacti can withstand high temperatures but require well-drained soil to prevent rot.",
        "They are suited to regions with very low humidity, mimicking desert conditions.",
        "Cold hardiness varies, but some species can tolerate light frost if dry."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Hedgehog cacti require full sun exposure to flourish, ideally 6 to 8 hours per day.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can result in poor growth and inadequate flowering of the cactus.",
        "Place in a south-facing window or outdoors in a spot with direct sunlight exposure.",
        "Protect them from scorching afternoon sun if temperatures exceed 100°F (37.8°C)."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water hedgehog cactus sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between watering sessions.",
        "Overwatering is a common cause of root rot; thus, it's crucial to avoid excess moisture.",
        "During the growing season (spring-summer), water more frequently, but with caution.",
        "Reduce watering significantly during the winter dormancy, once every month or less."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Hedgehog cacti thrive best in well-draining soil, ideally a cactus or succulent mix.",
        "The soil should be gritty with a high sand or perlite content to enhance drainage.",
        "Avoid dense, clayey soils as they retain moisture, leading to potential root rot.",
        "For containers, ensure drainage holes are present and use a pot with breathable material."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Hedgehog cacti are generally not known to be toxic to pets or humans if handled appropriately.",
        "However, the spines can cause physical injury, so handle them with care and proper attire."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Rotate the cactus periodically to ensure even sunlight exposure on all sides.",
        "Fertilize during the growing season with a balanced cactus-specific fertilizer.",
        "Prune dead flowers and damaged parts to maintain healthy growth and aesthetics.",
        "Monitor for pests like spider mites, which can occasionally infest the cactus."
