    "name": "Hibiscus",
    "climate": [
        "Hibiscus plants thrive in tropical to subtropical climates. They prefer warm temperatures and high humidity levels commonly found in these areas.",
        "In temperate climates, hibiscus can be grown as annuals or brought indoors during colder months to sustain their growth and flowering.",
        "They are not frost-tolerant, so they need protection when temperatures drop significantly, particularly in regions with cold winter weather.",
        "Hibiscus require a stable climate with minimal temperature fluctuations throughout the year to grow healthily and maintain their beautiful blooms."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Hibiscus plants require full sun exposure for at least six to eight hours a day to produce their stunning flowers.",
        "They thrive best when placed in a location that receives direct sunlight, such as a south-facing window if grown indoors.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can result in reduced flowering and leggy growth, making sunlight a crucial element for hibiscus health.",
        "In extremely hot climates, afternoon shade may prevent stress, but overall, more sunlight means more blooms for hibiscus plants."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Hibiscus plants require consistent moisture in the soil to keep them healthy and blooming, especially during their growth season.",
        "Allow the top inch of soil to dry between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage.",
        "During hot weather, hibiscus plants may need watering on a daily basis since they can become quickly dehydrated in high temperatures.",
        "In cooler weather, reduce watering frequency, but maintain enough moisture to prevent the plant from wilting or becoming overly dry."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is essential for hibiscus plants, as they are prone to root rot if the soil retains too much moisture.",
        "A loamy, rich soil that retains some moisture but does not become waterlogged is ideal for hibiscus growth and flowering.",
        "Adding organic matter such as compost can improve soil fertility, providing necessary nutrients to support healthy plant development.",
        "Ensure soil pH is slightly acidic to neutral, as this range is optimal for nutrient absorption and overall plant health."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Hibiscus is generally non-toxic to humans, but some species can be mildly toxic to pets, causing stomach upset if ingested by dogs or cats.",
        "It's always best to keep hibiscus plants out of reach of curious pets to prevent potential ingestion and related health issues."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning of hibiscus encourages bushier growth and more abundant flowering throughout the plant's blooming season.",
        "Hibiscus plants benefit from regular feeding with a high-potassium fertilizer, particularly during active growth phases."
