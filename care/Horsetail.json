    "name": "Horsetail",
    "climate": [
        "Horsetail thrives best in temperate climates with mild temperatures throughout the year.",
        "This plant is often found in climates that include wetlands or marshy areas naturally.",
        "It can tolerate colder climates but may not survive extreme freezing conditions for extended periods.",
        "A humid climate is beneficial for horsetail, as it thrives in areas with consistent moisture."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Horsetail prefers full sunlight but can tolerate partial shade for part of the day.",
        "It can grow in shaded areas, but optimal growth requires sufficient light exposure.",
        "Avoid low-light conditions, as they can impede the growth and health of the horsetail.",
        "Ensure the plant receives at least a few hours of direct sunlight daily for robust growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Horsetail requires consistently moist conditions, resembling its native marsh habitat.",
        "It's important to ensure the soil is not allowed to dry out completely at any time.",
        "Watering frequently may be necessary, especially in drier or hotter conditions.",
        "Maintain a water source nearby or ensure regular irrigation to mimic natural wetland conditions."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Horsetail thrives in nutrient-poor soils, especially those high in sand or clay content.",
        "It prefers acidic to neutral soil pH, typically found in wetland areas in the wild.",
        "Ensure the soil retains moisture well, mirroring the plant's natural marshy environments.",
        "Avoid overly fertile soil, as rich soil conditions may lead to unwanted growth issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Horsetail contains thiaminase, an enzyme that can deplete vitamin B1 in animals if ingested in large quantities.",
        "It can be toxic to grazing animals, such as horses and livestock, causing symptoms like weakness."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Trim back horsetail regularly to control its vigorous spread and maintain desired area coverage.",
        "Use barriers to prevent the plant from spreading invasively into areas where it is not wanted."
