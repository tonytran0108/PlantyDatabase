    "name": "Hummingbird Bush",
    "climate": [
        "The Hummingbird Bush thrives in a warm climate that supports its growth and blooming potential.",
        "This plant is adapted to survive in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 11, where winters are mild.",
        "Hot and dry conditions are well-suited for the Hummingbird Bush, mimicking its native habitat.",
        "In areas with high humidity, ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases on the plant."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun exposure is necessary for the Hummingbird Bush to bloom profusely and maintain health.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but reduced sunlight may lead to decreased flowering.",
        "Position the plant in a spot where it gets at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "In very hot climates, some afternoon shade could help prevent leaf scorching in extreme heat."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "The Hummingbird Bush is drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering.",
        "Water deeply and infrequently to encourage deep root growth, especially during dry periods.",
        "Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot; well-drained soil helps prevent this issue.",
        "In periods of extended drought, occasional watering might be needed to maintain plant vitality."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot, commonly an issue with poor drainage.",
        "Sandy or rocky soil types mimic the Hummingbird Bush's natural environment best.",
        "Soil pH should be mildly acidic to neutral to support optimal nutrient uptake and growth.",
        "Amending the soil with organic matter can improve nutrient availability and structure."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune the Hummingbird Bush regularly to encourage bushy growth and remove dead wood.",
        "Mulching around the plant can help moderate soil temperature and retain moisture.",
        "To attract more hummingbirds, plant in clusters and maintain a garden with diverse blooms.",
        "Regularly check for pests like aphids and caterpillars, which can affect plant health."
