    "name": "Hyacinth",
    "climate": [
        "Hyacinths thrive in temperate climates, where cool winters provide necessary dormancy.",
        "They require a period of chill to break dormancy and bloom properly in spring.",
        "Warm climates may require artificial cooling for proper bulb dormancy.",
        "Avoid tropical climates as heat and humidity can negatively impact growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Hyacinths prefer full sun conditions for optimal blooming and growth.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but may result in reduced flowering.",
        "Ensure they get at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, preferably in the morning.",
        "Avoid full shade as insufficient light will lead to weak, leggy growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Hyacinths require well-draining soil to prevent bulb rot from excess moisture.",
        "Water moderately, ensuring soil dries out slightly between watering sessions.",
        "Overwatering can be detrimental; the bulbs are prone to waterlogged conditions.",
        "During dormancy, significantly reduce watering to mimic natural rest periods."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Loamy or sandy soil types are ideal, providing efficient drainage and aeration.",
        "Soil should be rich in organic matter to supply nutrients during blooming.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels between 6.0 and 7.0 are recommended.",
        "Ensure soil is not compacted; proper drainage prevents potential bulb rot."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Hyacinths are toxic if consumed by humans and pets, causing stomach upset.",
        "The bulbs contain oxalic acid, which can lead to skin irritation on contact."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "For large blooms, consider feeding with balanced fertilizer during the growing season.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature during growth."
