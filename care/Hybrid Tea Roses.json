    "climate": [
        "Hybrid Tea Roses thrive in temperate climates with distinct seasons, allowing them to experience both warm and cold periods.",
        "They prefer regions where temperatures do not plummet too low in winter, avoiding frost damage to the stems and roots.",
        "Consistent weather with minimal humidity extremes ensures the roses bloom well and maintain their vibrant health.",
        "A balance of rainfall, avoiding overly wet conditions, is crucial to prevent root rot and other moisture-related issues."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Hybrid Tea Roses need full sunlight exposure for at least six hours a day to ensure optimal blooming and growth.",
        "While they thrive best in full sun, providing some afternoon shade in extremely hot climates is beneficial.",
        "Sunlight encourages healthy photosynthesis and vibrant flower colors, essential for robust rose health.",
        "Avoid planting in too much shade as lack of sunlight can lead to poor flowering and weak, spindly stems."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is crucial, especially in dry spells, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "Deep watering once or twice a week encourages deep root growth, essential for drought resistance and stability.",
        "Water at the base of the plant to keep foliage dry, lowering the risk of fungal diseases from moisture-laden leaves.",
        "Adjust watering frequency based on climate changes; too much water can lead to root diseases and poor plant health."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil enriched with organic matter like compost provides the best foundation for Hybrid Tea Roses.",
        "Slightly acidic soil, with a pH ranging from 6.0 to 6.8, is ideal to support nutrient uptake and availability.",
        "Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth, aiding in rose health.",
        "Regular re-fertilization of the soil is necessary, as these roses are heavy feeders requiring rich sustenance."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "All parts of the rose plant, including leaves, stems, and flowers, can cause minor gastrointestinal upset if ingested."
