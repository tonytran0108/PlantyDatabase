    "name": "Ice Plant",
    "climate": [
        "Ice plants thrive in temperate climates where freezing temperatures are rare.", 
        "They prefer mild, coastal climates similar to their native South African habitat.", 
        "These plants can tolerate some frost but not prolonged cold temperatures.", 
        "In hotter regions, they grow well in areas with moderate humidity."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun exposure is needed for ice plants to bloom profusely and grow healthily.", 
        "Ice plants thrive best when they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.", 
        "In hot climates, they may need some shade during the harshest afternoon sun.", 
        "Inadequate sunlight can result in sparse flowering and weak growth in these plants."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Ice plants require infrequent watering as they are drought-tolerant succulents.", 
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; let the soil dry completely between waterings.", 
        "In winter, reduce watering significantly to mimic their natural dormant period.", 
        "In the growing season, water deeply but infrequently ensuring soil drains well."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining, sandy or gravelly soil is ideal to prevent waterlogging.", 
        "Poorly draining soils can cause root rot, so amending soil with sand is helpful.", 
        "They thrive in soils with low organic matter, replicating their native conditions.", 
        "Ensure soil pH is lean towards slightly acidic to neutral for optimal growth."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune ice plants regularly to remove dead flowers and encourage new growth.", 
        "Propagate easily by taking stem cuttings and allowing them to root in sandy soil."
