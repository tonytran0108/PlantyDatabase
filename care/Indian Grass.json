    "name": "Indian Grass",
    "climate": [
        "Indian Grass thrives in a temperate climate, preferring well-defined seasons.",
        "It is highly adaptable and can tolerate cold winters and hot summers effectively.",
        "In areas with high humidity, Indian Grass still performs reliably.",
        "This grass is also resilient in areas with occasional drought conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Indian Grass grows best in full sunlight where it can bask for several hours a day.",
        "Partial shade is tolerated, but it may lead to less vigorous growth and fewer flowers.",
        "Adequate sunlight is essential for the development of its characteristic tall stalks.",
        "Consistent sun exposure ensures the grass maintains its vibrant seasonal colors."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Once established, Indian Grass is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering.",
        "Over-watering can lead to root rot; well-draining soil is crucial for this grass.",
        "During the initial growth phase, regular watering helps establish deep root systems.",
        "For optimal growth, water Indian Grass less during its dormant winter months."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Indian Grass adapts to a wide range of soil types, including poor, sandy soils.",
        "For best results, plant it in fertile, well-drained soils where it can drain freely.",
        "The grass can tolerate nutrient-poor soils, but benefits from occasional composting.",
        "Heavy clay soils should be amended to improve drainage and root penetration."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "For taller growth and more blooms, provide a balanced organic fertilizer seasonally.",
        "Indian Grass should be cut back in early spring to allow fresh shoots to emerge.",
        "Dividing clumps every few years helps control spread and rejuvenates the plant.",
        "Regular monitoring for pests, such as grasshoppers, is suggested to maintain health."
