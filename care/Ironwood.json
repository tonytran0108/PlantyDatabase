    "name": "Ironwood",
    "climate": ["The Ironwood tree is suited to dry, arid environments often found in desert areas.", "It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, where temperatures are consistently warm.", "In temperate zones, Ironwood can survive if protected from harsh winters and frost.", "The tree prefers climates with low humidity, making it ideal for Mediterranean-like environments."],
    "sunlight": ["Ironwood trees require full sunlight exposure for the majority of the day to grow optimally.", "They are adapted to regions with intense sun and can tolerate extreme heat conditions.", "Partial shade can be tolerated, but full growth potential might not be achieved in less sunlight.", "Consistent sunlight helps maintain the health and vigor of Ironwood, promoting strong wood development."],
    "watering": ["Ironwood has a high drought tolerance but benefits from occasional deep watering.", "Young trees need regular watering until established, after which they require less frequent attention.", "Over-watering can lead to root rot, so it's important to let the soil dry between watering.", "In their native environment, Ironwoods rely on minimal rainfall, adapting well to low-water conditions."],
    "soil": ["Ironwood trees prefer well-drained soils, preventing water from lingering around roots.", "They can thrive in poor, rocky soils where other plants might struggle to grow.", "Loamy soil conditions provide the best nutrient balance for Ironwood's healthy development.", "Their adaptability to sandy soils allows them to grow in challenging, nutrient-poor environments."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["To protect from pests, regular monitoring and application of horticultural oil may be required.", "Ironwood trees can benefit from periodic pruning to remove dead branches and enhance form.", "Mulching around the base can conserve moisture and reduce weed competition in the root zone.", "Fertilization is rarely necessary, but a light application in spring can boost growth if needed."]
