    "name": "Italian Cypress",
    "climate": [
        "Italian Cypress thrives in a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.",
        "This plant prefers regions with a low to moderate level of humidity, as high humidity can lead to fungal issues.",
        "It can tolerate a wide temperature range, but does best in areas where temperatures are above freezing in winter.",
        "Italian Cypress is generally not suited for tropical or very cold climates; severe frost can damage the plant."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "This tree requires full sunlight for optimal growth and health, receiving more than six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Partial shade can be tolerated, but insufficient sunlight may lead to a sparse and unhealthy appearance.",
        "Ensure it is planted in an open location where other structures do not obstruct sunlight for long periods.",
        "Positioning it in a south-facing location can help maximize sun exposure and aid growth in cooler climates."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Once established, Italian Cypress is drought-tolerant but should be watered regularly during dry spells.",
        "During the initial growing stages, consistent watering is necessary to promote healthy root development.",
        "Avoid overwatering as this can lead to root rot; ensure the soil dries out between waterings.",
        "In winter, reduce watering significantly unless the climate is extremely dry, then monitor soil moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Italian Cypress thrives in well-drained soils; it is essential to prevent waterlogging at the roots.",
        "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral; a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal for healthy growth.",
        "Amending the soil with organic matter can enhance nutrient availability, especially in poorer soils.",
        "Poorly drained, heavy clay soils should be avoided, or amended with sand and organic matter for better drainage."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly inspect for aphid infestations, especially during the growing season, to prevent pest damage.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain moisture and maintain a cooler root environment in hot climates."
