    "name": "Jade Plant",
    "climate": [
        "Jade plants thrive in warm and dry environments like a desert climate.",
        "They are well-suited for indoor settings with low humidity levels.",
        "During the summer, they prefer temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C).",
        "In winter, they can tolerate cooler temperatures but should be kept above 50°F (10°C)."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Jade plants require a lot of sunlight and do best in bright light.",
        "Direct sunlight for a significant portion of the day enhances their growth.",
        "A south-facing window is ideal because it provides consistent light levels.",
        "They can tolerate lower light conditions but may grow slower or leggier."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Overwatering is a common issue; allow the soil to dry between waterings.",
        "In the growing season (spring and summer), water them regularly but sparingly.",
        "In the dormant season (fall and winter), reduce watering significantly.",
        "Ensure excess water can drain away to prevent root rot, a serious risk."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Use a well-draining soil mix, preferably a cactus or succulent blend.",
        "The soil should retain some moisture but not hold too much that leads to rot.",
        "Adding sand or perlite can help improve soil drainage which is crucial.",
        "Jade plants thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soil pH for optimal health."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Jade plants are toxic to pets, including cats and dogs.",
        "Ingestion can cause symptoms like vomiting, lethargy, and abdominal pain.",

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning helps maintain their shape and encourages bushier growth.",
        "Dust can accumulate on leaves, so gently wipe them with a damp cloth.",
        "During the growing season, occasional feeding with a balanced fertilizer can be beneficial.",
        "Repotting every few years can promote healthy growth and check root conditions."
