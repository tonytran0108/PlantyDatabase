    "name": "Japanese Maple",
    "climate": [
        "Japanese Maple trees thrive in temperate climates with distinct seasons, requiring cool to cold winters for dormancy.",
        "They prefer regions with adequate rainfall distributed throughout the year, avoiding extreme drought or excessive moisture.",
        "These trees need protection from harsh winds and extreme weather conditions to maintain their delicate foliage.",
        "Ideal growing conditions include areas with humidity levels that are neither too high nor too low, providing balanced air moisture."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Japanese Maples grow best in partial shade, especially in hot climates, to prevent leaf scorch and stress.",
        "In cooler regions, they can tolerate more sun exposure but still benefit from afternoon shade.",
        "Direct sunlight for long periods can cause damage, making dappled shade optimal for maintaining vibrant leaf color.",
        "They require protection from intense sun, especially during the hottest parts of the day, to promote healthy growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent, moderate watering is essential for Japanese Maples, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.",
        "During dry periods, these trees benefit from additional water to prevent drought stress and leaf browning.",
        "They require regular irrigation, particularly in their first few years, to establish deep and robust roots.",
        "Avoid watering with hard water as it can affect soil pH and nutrient availability, impacting overall health."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Japanese Maples prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soils that are rich in organic matter for optimal growth.",
        "They thrive best in sandy loam or clay soils with good aeration to support healthy root development.",
        "Amending soil with compost or leaf mold can improve nutrient content and aid moisture retention.",
        "Avoid planting in heavy, compacted soils as they can lead to root rot and other health issues for the tree."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Japanese Maple leaves and seeds are generally non-toxic to humans and pets but should not be ingested in large quantities."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning in late winter can help maintain shape and remove any dead or crossing branches for improved air circulation.",
        "Mulching around the base can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature, enhancing growth conditions.",
        "Protect young trees from deer and other wildlife that may cause damage to the tender branches and leaves.",
        "Fertilize sparingly in early spring with a balanced, slow-release formula to prevent nutrient deficiencies."
