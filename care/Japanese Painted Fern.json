    "climate": [
        "Japanese Painted Ferns thrive in moderate to high humidity conditions and benefit from being in a moist environment.",
        "They are well-suited to mild and temperate climates where temperature fluctuations are minimal.",
        "This fern prefers cooler climates, ideally where summers don't get excessively hot, as heat can cause stress.",
        "Avoid placing them in very dry or arid climates, as they require consistent moisture to thrive."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Japanese Painted Ferns prefer dappled sunlight, such as the light found under a canopy of trees.",
        "It's ideal to place them in a location with partial shade to prevent sunburn on their delicate fronds.",
        "In regions with intense sunlight, they should be shielded from direct rays to maintain optimal health.",
        "Avoid planting them in full sun as it can lead to leaf scorch and dehydration issues over time."

    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "During dry spells or hot weather, increase watering frequency to compensate for increased evaporation.",
        "Ensure the soil does not dry out completely between waterings, as this can cause stress to the plant.",
        "Use lukewarm water to mimic natural conditions and avoid shocking the plant with cold water."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "This fern thrives best in rich, well-draining soil that retains some moisture without becoming soggy.",
        "A soil mix enriched with organic matter like compost or leaf mold will provide essential nutrients.",
        "It prefers slightly acidic to neutral pH levels, which help maintain nutrient availability for root absorption.",
        "Avoid compacted soils as they can hinder root growth and reduce the plant's vigor and health."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Mulching around the base with organic material helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.",
        "Regularly trim away dead or damaged fronds to maintain plant health and improve visual appearance."
