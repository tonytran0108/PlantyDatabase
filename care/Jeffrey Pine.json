    "name": "Jeffrey Pine",
    "climate": [
        "Jeffrey Pine thrives in mountainous regions with cold winters and warm summers, typically found at elevations above 1,500 meters.",
        "The climate for this tree is characterized by low humidity and a high temperature range, supporting its growth in subalpine zones.",
        "Areas with frequent snowfall in winter and dry summers create the ideal conditions necessary for the survival of the Jeffrey Pine.",
        "It naturally occurs in climates with severe weather conditions, where the temperature can drop significantly in the winter months."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Jeffrey Pine requires full sunlight exposure to properly photosynthesize and grow to its full potential.",
        "Adapted to high-altitude environments, it is accustomed to high levels of direct sunlight throughout the day.",
        "For optimal growth, the tree should not be shaded by other objects, ensuring that it receives ample sunlight from dawn till dusk.",
        "This tree is best suited for open spaces where it can receive unfiltered sunlight, which aids in its overall health and vigor."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Jeffrey Pine prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.",
        "It requires minimal watering once established but benefits from occasional deep watering during prolonged dry periods.",
        "Watering should be done sparingly as excess moisture can lead to root rot, which is detrimental to Jeffrey Pine.",
        "The tree reflects its drought-resistant nature; ensure soil is dry between watering to prevent overwatering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "The tree thrives in sandy, well-drained soils typical of its native mountainous habitat, reducing the risk of waterlogging.",
        "Acidic to neutral pH levels are preferable for Jeffrey Pine to absorb essential nutrients effectively from the soil.",
        "The substrate should be composed of a mix of sand and loam to replicate its natural growing conditions favorably.",
        "Nutrient-poor soils do not hinder its growth, though they should still be well-drained to avoid saturation-related issues."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular inspections for signs of disease or pests are necessary, as early spotting can prevent significant damage to the tree.",
        "Pruning should be done in late winter or early spring to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches."
