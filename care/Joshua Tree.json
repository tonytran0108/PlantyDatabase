        "Joshua Trees thrive in arid climates, typically found in desert regions.",
        "They prefer areas with extremely low rainfall and very hot temperatures.",
        "This plant is adapted to survive in climates where extreme heat is common.",
        "Cold temperatures can occur, but they are tolerant of some frost."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun exposure is essential for the healthy growth of Joshua Trees.",
        "They need at least six hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor growth and reduced lifespan.",
        "Direct sunlight conditions mimic their natural desert environment."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Joshua Trees require minimal watering due to their desert origins.",
        "Excess watering can lead to root rot, which can be detrimental.",
        "During dry spells, occasional deep watering can support growth but sparingly.",
        "Allow the soil to dry out completely between watering sessions."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining sandy or rocky soils are ideal for Joshua Trees.",
        "Soils should mimic their natural desert conditions for optimal growth.",
        "Poor or compacted soil can hinder root development and overall health.",
        "Amend soil with gravel or sand to improve drainage and aeration."
