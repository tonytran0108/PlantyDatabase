        "Prefers temperate climates that are neither too hot nor too cold.",
        "Thrives well in urban environments where pollution might be present.",
        "It can tolerate cold climates and even survive through frosty conditions.",
        "Does well in regions with warm summers and cool, damp winters."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Requires full sun exposure to ensure strong and upright growth.",
        "Can tolerate partial shade but may lead to less vigorous flowering.",
        "Ensures optimal leaf coloration with at least six hours of sun daily.",
        "Avoid full shady areas as these can lead to leggy plants with fewer blooms."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Once established, it is drought tolerant, requiring less frequent watering.",
        "Maintain moisture during the first year to establish deep root systems.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so allow the soil to dry out slightly.",
        "In particularly dry climates, weekly deep watering is more beneficial."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-drained soils to avoid waterlogged conditions at the roots.",
        "Can thrive in slightly sandy soils that allow effective drainage.",
        "Adaptable to a variety of soil types, including clay and loam soils.",
        "Requires average fertility; too rich soil may cause it to flop over."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Cut back the plant close to the ground in early spring to encourage healthy growth.",
        "To maintain a tidy appearance, remove dead or damaged foliage promptly.",
        "While generally low-maintenance, dividing clumps every few years rejuvenates growth.",
        "Be proactive in dividing older clumps as they can become unkempt and reduced in vigor."
