    "name": "Larch",
    "climate": [
        "Larch trees thrive in cool and temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes.",
        "They are well-suited to regions with cold winters and mild summers.",
        "They require a climate that provides relief from extreme heat and warmth.",
        "In their natural habitat, larches experience heavy snowfall and long frost periods."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Larch trees prefer full sunlight for optimal growth and development.",
        "They need a location with unobstructed access to direct sunlight throughout the day.",
        "Partial shade conditions may hinder their growth and branch formation.",
        "A lack of sufficient sunlight can lead to poor foliage color and weaker branches."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Larches generally require moderate watering, adapting to seasonal precipitation.",
        "In periods of drought, ensure the soil around the larch is kept moist but not waterlogged.",
        "They prefer consistent moisture levels without prolonged dry spells.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering may cause foliage browning."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Larch trees grow best in well-drained soil rich in organic matter and nutrients.",
        "The ideal soil for larches has a slightly acidic to neutral pH level with good aeration.",
        "Compacted or waterlogged soils can negatively impact larch tree health and stability.",
        "Loamy soil that retains moisture without becoming overly saturated is preferred."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Larch trees are generally non-toxic to humans and animals."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning should be done in late winter or early spring to shape the tree effectively."
