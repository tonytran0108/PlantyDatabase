    "name": "Larkspur",
    "climate": [
        "Larkspur thrives best in a temperate climate where temperatures are moderate.",
        "It prefers environments with well-defined seasons, particularly a cold winter season.",
        "Extreme heat can damage larkspur; it does not do well in very hot climates.",
        "A climate with mild, cool summers allows for optimal growth and blooming."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Larkspur plants require full sunlight to develop strong stems and vibrant flowers.",
        "They thrive in areas where they can receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Partial shade is tolerable, but full sun exposure ensures best flowering results.",
        "Avoid planting in heavily shaded areas as it significantly stunts their growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Larkspur requires moderate and consistent watering for optimum growth.",
        "It's crucial to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged to prevent root rot.",
        "Ensure the plant's roots are well-drained; they dislike overly wet environments.",
        "If rainfall is insufficient, especially during dry spells, additional watering is necessary."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is essential to keep the roots of larkspur healthy.",
        "They prefer a pH range that is slightly acidic to neutral for optimal growth.",
        "The addition of organic matter can improve nutrient content and soil structure.",
        "Sandy or loamy soil types are ideal as they allow proper drainage and aeration."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Larkspur is toxic to humans and animals if ingested, causing severe symptoms.",
        "Signs include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, death.",
        "Handle with care; wear gloves when pruning to avoid skin irritation or toxicity.",
        "Keep children and pets away from the plant due to its high toxicity levels."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead spent flowers to encourage prolonged blooming and plant vigor.",
        "Apply mulch around the base to conserve moisture and reduce weed competition.",
        "Support taller varieties with stakes to prevent them from falling over in strong winds.",
        "Inspect regularly for aphids and other pests which may consume the sap from stems."
