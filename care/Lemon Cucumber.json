    "name": "Lemon Cucumber",
    "climate": [
        "Lemon cucumbers thrive in warm, temperate climates with plenty of sunshine.", 
        "They can be grown in regions with hot summers and mild to moderate winter temperatures.", 
        "While they prefer temperate climates, they can tolerate short periods of cooler temperatures.", 
        "This plant is sensitive to frost and must not be exposed to freezing conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Lemon cucumbers require full sunlight exposure for optimal growth and fruit production.", 
        "They should receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily for best results.", 
        "In partial shade conditions, the plant growth may be stunted and yields reduced.", 
        "While they prefer full sun, protection from the most intense midday sun can prevent leaf scorching."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential for lemon cucumbers, as they need consistent moisture.", 
        "Ensure the soil is kept evenly moist but not waterlogged to support healthy growth.", 
        "During hot and dry periods, increase watering frequency to prevent dehydration.", 
        "The use of mulch can help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Lemon cucumbers thrive in well-drained soil with a rich, loamy texture.", 
        "The soil should be fertile, high in organic matter, and retain moisture well.", 
        "Avoid heavy clay soils or poorly drained areas, as these can impede root growth.", 
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH, ideally between 6.0 and 7.0, is best for this plant."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Train the lemon cucumber vines on a trellis to improve air circulation and save space.", 
        "Regularly check for pests like aphids and cucumber beetles, which can harm the plant.", 
        "Prune excess foliage to enhance sunlight penetration and reduce disease risk.", 
        "Harvest the fruit when it's young and tender for the best flavor and texture."
