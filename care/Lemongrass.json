    "climate": [
        "Lemongrass thrives in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures are warm year-round.",
        "This plant prefers a climate with high humidity to mimic its natural environment for optimal growth.",
        "It is best suited for USDA hardiness zones 9 and above, with minimal risk of frost.",
        "Cool climates are not ideal for lemongrass as they can stunt growth and cause damage."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Lemongrass requires full sun to grow, needing at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "In partial shade environments, lemongrass may struggle to reach its full growth potential.",
        "For best results, place lemongrass in a south-facing location where sunlight is abundant.",
        "Inadequate sunlight exposure can lead to weak, spindly plants with reduced vigor."

    "watering": [
        "Lemongrass needs consistent moisture, so water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist.",
        "Avoid letting the soil dry out completely between watering as it can stress the plant.",
        "In hot weather, increase watering frequency to maintain adequate soil moisture levels.",
        "Although it likes moisture, ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot due to overwatering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained loamy soil is ideal for lemongrass, providing balanced nutrients.",
        "The soil should be rich in organic matter to support healthy growth and development.",
        "It can tolerate a range of soil pH but thrives best in slightly acidic to neutral conditions.",
        "Avoid heavy clay or overly sandy soils as they can impede water retention and drainage."
