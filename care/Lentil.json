    "name": "Lentil",
    "climate": [
        "Lentils thrive in temperate climates with moderate temperatures.",
        "They are well-suited for regions with Mediterranean climates.",
        "Avoid extremely hot climates; they do not tolerate heat well.",
        "Cold climates can hinder growth, ideally avoid frost conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Lentils require full sun for optimal growth and productivity.",
        "They need at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "Inadequate sunlight leads to poor development and lower yield.",
        "Partial shade can severely reduce flowering and seed formation."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Lentils need moderate watering, mainly during germination and flowering.",
        "Overwatering can cause root rot, so soil should be well-draining.",
        "Once established, lentils are quite drought-tolerant and need less water.",
        "Waterlogging is detrimental; allow soil to dry between waterings."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained sandy or loamy soils are ideal for lentil growth.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils which retain too much water and suffocate roots.",
        "Neutral to slightly alkaline soil pH is best, ideally between 6 to 7.5.",
        "Fertile soil rich in organic matter enhances lentil seed production."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Lentils fix nitrogen; rotate crops to improve subsequent soil fertility.",
        "Weed control is crucial early in the growing season for lentils.",
        "Remove pests such as aphids, which can impact yield significantly.",
        "Harvest when pods are firm and dry to avoid losing seeds to shattering."
