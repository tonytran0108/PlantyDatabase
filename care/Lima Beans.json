    "name": "Lima Beans",
    "climate": [
        "Lima beans thrive in a temperate climate with moderate temperatures.",
        "These plants prefer environments with a consistent temperature above 60°F.",
        "Avoid exposing Lima beans to frost, as they are sensitive to cold weather.",
        "Well-drained soils in sunny locations are ideal for growing Lima beans."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Lima beans require full sun exposure for optimal growth, about 6-8 hours daily.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but it might reduce the yield significantly.",
        "Ensure the plants receive direct sunlight to boost photosynthesis efficiently.",
        "A sunny location helps the beans to flower and produce pods successfully."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Lima beans need consistent watering, especially during dry spells.",
        "Water the plants deeply once a week to keep the soil moist but not soggy.",
        "Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot or waterlogging conditions.",
        "Providing mulch can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Lima beans grow best in rich, loamy soil with good drainage properties.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, between 6.0 and 7.0 for optimal growth.",
        "Incorporate organic matter or compost to improve soil fertility and structure.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils as they can retain too much water, affecting root health."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Mulching around the base of the plants can help conserve moisture and suppress weeds.",
        "Supporting the plants with stakes or trellises can help manage their growth and flowering.",
        "Regularly inspect the plants for signs of Aphids or other pests and manage promptly.",
        "Practice crop rotation to reduce soil-borne diseases and enhance soil health each year."
