    "name": "Limelight Hydrangea",
    "climate": [
        "The Limelight Hydrangea thrives best in a temperate climate, enjoying moderate temperatures without extreme variations.",
        "A humid climate is preferable as it helps maintain moisture levels, ensuring healthy growth and vibrant blooming.",
        "The plant can tolerate cold climates but may require protective measures during harsh winter conditions to prevent damage.",
        "Limelight Hydrangeas do not fare well in extremely arid climates as the lack of humidity can lead to wilting and poor health."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Limelight Hydrangeas prefer full sun, but in hotter climates, some afternoon shade can protect the plant.",
        "Partial shade is beneficial in regions with intense sunlight, helping to prevent leaf scorch and dehydration.",
        "Avoid planting in deep shade as inadequate sunlight can result in fewer blooms and weaker growth overall.",
        "Sunlight exposure should be balanced to ensure robust flowering while preventing stress from excessive heat."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is crucial, particularly in dry spells, as Limelight Hydrangeas require regular moisture in their soil.",
        "Deep watering methods are essential to encourage a strong root system, promoting stability and resilience in the plant.",
        "Over-watering must be avoided as waterlogged conditions can lead to root rot and other fungal diseases.",
        "A mulch layer around the base can help retain moisture and minimize the frequency of watering needed over time."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Limelight Hydrangeas flourish in well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter for optimal nutrient availability.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH is best, as it ensures nutrient absorption without causing plant stress or deficiency.",
        "Soil should be consistently moist yet well-aerated to promote healthy root development and prevent compaction.",
        "Amending soil with compost or other organic fertilizers can benefit overall growth and blooming potential significantly."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Limelight Hydrangea contains cyanogenic glycosides, making it toxic if ingested by humans and pets."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning in late winter or early spring can help maintain shape and encourage vigorous blooms during the flowering season."
