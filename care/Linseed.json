    "name": "Linseed",
    "climate": [
        "Linseed prefers a temperate climate, thriving in regions with cool temperatures.",
        "It grows best in areas where summers are mild and without excessive heat.",
        "High humidity can negatively impact linseed, increasing disease risks.",
        "Linseed requires regions that experience moderate rainfall or irrigation."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Linseed performs best in full sunlight, requiring ample sun each day.",
        "It requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight for optimal growth.",
        "Partial shade can hinder linseed growth, leading to lower seed yield.",
        "Ensure linseed is planted in an area that receives unfiltered sunlight."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is important to maintain soil moisture in linseed.",
        "Linseed should not experience drought stress, especially during flowering.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot in linseed plants.",
        "Moderate watering helps linseed grow without causing waterlogging issues."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Linseed thrives in well-drained, fertile loam soils for good growth.",
        "It requires a soil pH range between 6.0 and 6.5 for best results.",
        "Soils high in organic matter improve linseed's growth and seed production.",
        "Heavy clay or waterlogged soils should be avoided to prevent growth issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Linseed contains cyanogenic glycosides, which can be toxic in large amounts.",
        "Proper processing of linseed is required to reduce potential toxicity."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Linseed fields benefit from crop rotation to prevent disease build-up.",
