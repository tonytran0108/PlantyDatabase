    "sunlight": ["The Little Leaf Linden requires full sun exposure to partial shade to thrive.", "It grows best in locations where it can receive at least six hours of sunlight daily.", "While it can tolerate partial shade, optimal growth and flowering occur in direct sunlight.", "In regions with intensely hot summers, some afternoon shade may help prevent foliage scorch."],
    "watering": ["Regular watering is necessary for young Little Leaf Linden trees to establish deep roots.", "Once established, it becomes moderately drought-tolerant but appreciates consistent moisture.", "During dry periods, deep watering can help maintain its health and vigor.", "Avoid waterlogging, as overly wet soil conditions can lead to root rot or fungal diseases."],
    "soil": ["The Little Leaf Linden prefers a well-draining soil, rich in organic matter for optimal growth.", "It can tolerate a range of soils, including clay, loam, and sandy types, as long as drainage is adequate.", "Avoid extremely acidic or alkaline soils; it thrives best in neutral to slightly acidic conditions.", "Improve poor soils with compost or well-rotted manure to boost fertility and structure."],
