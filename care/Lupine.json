    "name": "Lupine",
    "climate": [
        "Lupines thrive in temperate climates with cool summers and mild winters, ideally in zones 4 to 8.",
        "They are adaptable to maritime climates, often flourishing in coastal regions with moderate temperatures.",
        "In Mediterranean climates, lupines might face challenges with hot, dry summers affecting their growth.",
        "They generally struggle in tropical climates due to high humidity and heat, which can cause fungal issues."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Lupines prefer full sun exposure to thrive, ensuring they receive at least six hours of sunlight daily.",
        "In hot climates, providing some partial shade during peak sunlight can prevent wilting and scorching.",
        "They can tolerate partial sun but may produce fewer flowers if sunlight is limited throughout the day.",
        "Ensuring full sunlight is crucial for lupines to develop strong, vibrant blooms and healthy foliage."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Lupines require well-drained soil to prevent root rot; avoid waterlogged conditions for best results.",
        "During the growing season, water lupines regularly, especially in dry periods, to keep soil moist but not soggy.",
        "Established lupines can tolerate some drought, though consistent watering promotes better blooming.",
        "In heavy rainfall areas, ensure soil drainage is excellent to prevent water from pooling around plants."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Lupines prefer well-drained, sandy or loamy soil rich in organic matter for optimal growth.",
        "They require slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, usually in the range of 6.0 to 7.5 for healthy growth.",
        "In clay-heavy soils, amending with sand or compost can enhance drainage and improve conditions for lupines.",
        "Proper soil preparation, including tilling and amending, supports root development and flowering in lupines."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Lupines contain alkaloids that can be toxic to pets and humans if ingested in large quantities.",
        "All parts of the plant, especially the seeds and pods, pose a risk of poisoning if consumed."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular deadheading of lupine flowers encourages continued blooming and prevents self-seeding.",
        "Protect young plants from aphids, a common pest, by using natural insecticidal soap as needed."
