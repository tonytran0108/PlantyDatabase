    "name": "Mango",
    "climate": [
        "Mango trees thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with warm temperatures.",
        "They require a climate that remains frost-free for good growth and fruit production.",
        "Ideal climates for mango trees also exhibit seasonal monsoon rains during the wet season.",
        "Dry periods with lower humidity are beneficial during the flowering and fruiting stages."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mango trees need full sun exposure for at least 8 to 10 hours a day to produce fruit.",
        "They perform best in locations with abundant sunlight throughout the entire year.",
        "Exposure to direct sunlight is crucial for healthy growth and good fruiting conditions.",
        "Insufficient sunlight may lead to poorer fruit quality and less productive trees."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Young mango trees require regular watering, especially during dry spells.",
        "Established trees are more drought-tolerant but still benefit from deep, infrequent watering.",
        "Overwatering can be detrimental, leading to root rot; well-drained soil is essential.",
        "Watering should be reduced during the winter months to prevent excessive moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Mango trees prefer well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral soil for optimal growth.",
        "They can grow in a variety of soils, but loamy or sandy soils are most ideal.",
        "Soil should have good water retention capability yet allow excess water to drain away.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain water, as this can lead to poor root development."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Mango skin and sap contain oils similar to poison ivy, which can cause dermatitis in sensitive individuals."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning is important for mango trees to enhance air circulation and sunlight penetration for better yields."
