    "name": "Marigold",
    "climate": [
        "Marigolds thrive in warm and sunny climates, providing vibrant blooms in various temperatures.",
        "These plants can tolerate a range of temperatures but prefer a mild frost-free climate for best growth.",
        "In regions with harsh winters, marigolds are often grown as annuals due to their dislike for cold.",
        "Marigolds adapt well to hot and dry climates but will need extra care during extreme heat."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Marigolds require full sun exposure, which means at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.",
        "To bloom extensively, marigolds should be planted in areas where they can receive ample sunlight.",
        "Partial shade may result in fewer blooms and leggy growth, reducing the plant's typical vibrancy.",
        "Growing marigolds in shaded areas can lead to poor flowering and weakened plant structure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "These flowers prefer regular watering, especially when young, but be cautious of overwatering.",
        "Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, particularly in containers.",
        "During periods of drought or extreme heat, increase watering frequency to keep them healthy.",
        "Soil should remain moderately moist, but avoid waterlogged conditions that can harm the plant."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Marigolds flourish in well-drained, moderately fertile soils that encourage robust growth.",
        "They can tolerate poor soil quality, though adding organic matter can enhance performance.",
        "Avoid heavy, clay-based soils unless amended, as they can hinder the plant's development.",
        "A balanced, nutrient-rich soil mix will promote vibrant blooms and strong foliage."
