    "watering": [
        "Meadow Rue prefers consistently moist soil, but water should not pool around the roots.",
        "In dry periods, regular watering is necessary to maintain moisture levels in the soil.",
        "The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely for optimal plant health.",
        "Ensure sufficient drainage as waterlogged conditions can lead to root rot."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "These plants thrive in rich, well-drained soils high in organic matter such as compost.",
        "The soil should retain moisture yet be loose enough to allow the roots to spread easily.",
        "Amending garden soil with organic materials can improve its structure and fertility.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is optimal for the growth of Meadow Rue."

        "Mulching around the base helps maintain soil moisture and regulate temperature.",
        "Regularly check for pests like aphids and manually remove them if present.",
        "In colder regions, applying a protective mulch layer can shield roots from frost."
