    "name": "Mexican Daisy",
    "climate": [
        "Mexican Daisies thrive in warm climates, preferring temperatures above 20°C.",
        "They are not frost-tolerant, and cold weather can damage or kill the plant.",
        "The plant grows well in climates with mild winters and hot summers.",
        "High humidity is not essential, but they do well in dry areas too."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mexican Daisies require full sun exposure for most of the day to bloom properly.",
        "While they can tolerate some shade, less sunlight results in fewer flowers.",
        "Sunlight helps the plant maintain its compact growth and bright blooms.",
        "In extremely hot regions, some afternoon shade can help prevent wilting."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential, especially during the growing season to encourage blooming.",
        "Allow the soil to dry out slightly between watering sessions to prevent root rot.",
        "In cooler months, reduce watering frequency as growth slows down.",
        "Avoid overhead watering to minimize the risk of fungal diseases in foliage."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Mexican Daisies thrive best in well-drained soil, rich in organic matter.",
        "They prefer sandy or loamy soil that allows excess water to drain quickly.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH range is ideal for optimal growth.",
        "Compacted or clay-heavy soils can be problematic, causing root issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadheading spent flowers can promote more blooming by redirecting energy.",
        "Consider applying a balanced fertilizer during the growing season for better blooms."
