    "name": "Mexican Feather Grass",
    "climate": [
        "Mexican Feather Grass thrives in a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters.",
        "It can handle semi-arid conditions and is drought tolerant once established.",
        "This grass is well-suited for temperate regions with low humidity levels.",
        "In colder climates, it may die back in winter but regrows in spring."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mexican Feather Grass prefers full sunlight for best growth and appearance.",
        "It can tolerate partial shade, but growth may be less vigorous.",
        "Morning sun with afternoon shade can work in very hot climates.",
        "It thrives in open areas with no obstruction to sunlight throughout the day."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Once established, it requires minimal watering due to drought tolerance.",
        "In the first year, regular watering helps in establishing a strong root system.",
        "Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot; let the soil dry between watering.",
        "During extended dry periods, provide supplemental watering to sustain foliage."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Requires well-drained soil; poor drainage can lead to fungal diseases.",
        "Grows best in sandy or gravelly soils that mimic its native conditions.",
        "Does well in nutrient-poor soils but can adapt to richer textures if needed.",
        "Soil pH should be neutral to slightly alkaline for optimal health and growth."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular trimming can prevent excessive seeding and maintain plant shape.",
        "Remove dead foliage in spring to encourage fresh growth and improve looks.",
        "Mulching around the base helps conserve moisture and control weed growth.",
        "In winter, protect young plants with a frost cover if temperatures drop severely."
