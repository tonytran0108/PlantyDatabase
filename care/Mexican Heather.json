    "name": "Mexican Heather",
    "climate": [
        "Mexican Heather thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It prefers warm temperatures and is sensitive to frost, so it is best suited for USDA hardiness zones 9 to 11 where it can grow year-round.",
        "In temperate regions, Mexican Heather can be grown as an annual or in containers that can be brought indoors during cold months. It requires a relatively high humidity environment to mimic its native tropical habitats.",
        "This plant does not tolerate cold drafts or temperatures that drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Ensure it's protected from harsh weather conditions to maintain healthy growth.",
        "Successful cultivation also requires locations with mild winters and warm summers. The heat and humidity in these areas help it to produce the best foliage and flowers."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mexican Heather thrives in full sun conditions for optimal growth. A location that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight a day is ideal for this plant.",
        "While it can tolerate partial shade, flowering may be reduced. The plant should be placed where it can receive morning sun and some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates.",
        "If using it as an indoor or container plant, place Mexican Heather near south-facing windows to maximize sunlight exposure. Lack of sufficient light can lead to leggy growth and poor flowering.",
        "It's important to gradually acclimate the plant to full sun to prevent leaf burn. This slow adjustment helps the plant to build resilience against harsh sunlight conditions."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Mexican Heather requires moderate watering to keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Adequate drainage is essential to prevent root rot.",
        "Water the plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, and ensure excess water drains away. Avoid frequent, shallow watering that can cause root distress.",
        "Adjust the watering frequency depending on the climate; during hot weather, it may need more frequent watering, while in cooler months, reduce the amount to prevent overwatering.",
        "If grown in containers, check moisture levels regularly as container plants can dry out faster than those planted in the ground, and water accordingly to maintain healthy growth."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Mexican Heather prefers well-draining soil that's rich in organic matter. A mix of equal parts potting soil and coarse sand or perlite can provide the perfect balance of moisture retention and drainage.",
        "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Regular soil pH testing helps maintain an optimal growing environment for Mexican Heather.",
        "Good drainage is critical; heavy clay soils can be amended with sand and compost to improve aeration and prevent waterlogging, which can harm the plant.",
        "Consistent soil moisture is crucial, so mulching can be beneficial to regulate temperature and humidity levels around the root zone by preventing water evaporation."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune Mexican Heather regularly to encourage bushiness and remove any dead or damaged foliage. This helps maintain its shape and promotes more vigorous flowering.",
        "Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season to support healthy growth and abundant blooms. Reduce feeding in late summer to prepare the plant for winter dormancy."
