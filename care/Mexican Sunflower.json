    "name": "Mexican Sunflower",
    "climate": [
        "Mexican Sunflowers thrive in warm climates where temperatures remain above freezing.",
        "These plants are ideal for USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11 due to their sensitivity to frost.",
        "They prefer regions with long growing seasons and minimal risk of frost during growth.",
        "In cooler climates, they are often grown as annuals to avoid freeze damage."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mexican Sunflowers require full sunlight for optimal growth and blooming.",
        "At least six to eight hours of direct sunlight is recommended each day.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can result in leggy plants with fewer blooms.",
        "Ensure the planting site is free from shaded areas for best results."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water Mexican Sunflowers regularly to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.",
        "Once established, they are relatively drought tolerant and need less frequent watering.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage in the soil.",
        "During hot and dry spells, more frequent watering may be necessary."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Mexican Sunflowers prefer well-drained soils rich in organic matter and nutrients.",
        "They can tolerate poor soils, but optimal growth occurs in fertile loamy soils.",
        "Good drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging and diseases like root rot.",
        "Soil pH should be neutral to slightly acidic, ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 for best growth."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pinch off the tops of young plants to encourage bushier growth and more blooms.",
        "Stake tall plants in windy areas to prevent them from falling over as they mature.",
        "Regularly deadhead faded blooms to encourage continuous flowering throughout the season.",
        "Watch for aphids and beetles, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap sprays."
