    "name": "Meyer Lemon",
    "climate": [
        "Meyer lemon trees thrive best in warm, subtropical climates where they can receive consistent heat throughout the growing season.",
        "They are sensitive to frost and require protection or indoor cultivation in regions with significant winter chill.",
        "Humidity can benefit Meyer lemon trees, but excessively high humidity may increase susceptibility to certain fungal diseases.",
        "These lemon trees prefer temperatures that do not drop below 50°F (10°C) for optimal growth and fruit production."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Meyer lemon trees require at least 8 to 12 hours of direct sunlight daily to ensure proper growth and fruit production.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but insufficient sunlight will significantly reduce the quantity and quality of fruits.",
        "Indoor-growing Meyer lemons should be placed in the sunniest window, preferably a south-facing location with maximum sunlight exposure.",
        "Supplemental grow lights may be necessary in areas with limited sunlight to maintain vigorous growth and fruit setting."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is crucial; soil should be kept moist but not waterlogged to prevent root rot and other issues.",
        "Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings to ensure that the tree is evenly hydrated.",
        "Reduce watering frequency during winter months when growth slows and the risk of overwatering increases.",
        "Consider using a drip irrigation system to provide slow and steady water supply directly to the roots of the tree."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-draining soil is essential to prevent water accumulation that can lead to root diseases in Meyer lemon trees.",
        "A mix of sandy and loamy soil enriched with organic matter provides the best environment for healthy tree growth.",
        "The pH level for optimal soil should be slightly acidic, ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 for nutrient availability.",
        "Regularly amending the soil with compost or a balanced fertilizer helps maintain nutrients and support fruit production."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Meyer lemon trees are not considered toxic to humans; however, the plant belongs to the citrus family, whose plants can cause skin irritation.",
        "Citrus oils found in the leaves, peel, and fruit may cause mild irritation to pets if ingested. Proper caution is advised."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning helps maintain tree shape, encourages airflow, and removes dead or crossing branches for optimal health.",
        "If kept indoors, periodically turn the plant to promote even growth towards the light source and prevent lopsided development.",
        "Monitor for common pests such as aphids and spider mites, using insecticidal soap or neem oil if infestations occur.",
        "Repotting every few years ensures adequate root space, promoting sustained growth and preventing the plant from becoming root-bound."
