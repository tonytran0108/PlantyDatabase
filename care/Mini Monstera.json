    "watering": [
        "Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering to prevent overwatering and root rot.",
        "Watering frequency may vary depending on climate, requiring more in warm temperatures.",
        "Use room temperature water, as cold water can shock the root system of the plant.",
        "Reduce watering during the cooler months when the plant's growth slows down significantly."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Mini Monstera grows well in a well-draining, aerated potting mix enriched with organic material.",
        "A mix of peat, perlite, and pine bark can provide the necessary drainage and nutrients.",
        "Avoid soils that retain excess moisture, as this can lead to root rot and plant stress.",
        "Repotting with fresh soil every couple of years helps maintain vitality and prevent compaction."

        "Regular pruning will promote bushier growth and keep the plant compact and healthy.",
        "Wipe leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust, allowing them to efficiently photosynthesize.",
        "Consider misting the plant regularly or using a humidifier to maintain high humidity levels.",
        "Rotate the plant periodically so all sides receive sufficient light, encouraging even growth."
