    "name": "Mistletoe Cactus",
    "climate": [
        "The Mistletoe Cactus thrives in warm, humid conditions similar to those found in tropical rainforests.",
        "This plant should be grown in temperatures ranging from 70°F to 80°F for optimal health.",
        "It can tolerate temperatures as low as 50°F but should be protected from frost.",
        "High humidity is ideal for the Mistletoe Cactus, mimicking its native conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "The Mistletoe Cactus prefers bright, indirect sunlight to mimic the dappled light of its natural habitat.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so it's best to avoid placing it in full sun.",
        "If grown indoors, a spot near an east-facing window provides suitable light conditions.",
        "In lower light conditions, the plant may become leggy and may not bloom as prolifically."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water the Mistletoe Cactus thoroughly, then allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the pot has proper drainage.",
        "Watering frequency may decrease during the cooler months as the plant's growth slows.",
        "The Mistletoe Cactus prefers water with lower lime content, similar to rainwater."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "The ideal soil for a Mistletoe Cactus is a well-draining mix, such as cactus potting soil.",
        "A mix of peat, pine bark, and perlite tends to perform well for this species.",
        "Soil should retain some moisture but allow excess to drain away quickly.",
        "Avoid heavy, clay-based soils that retain too much moisture and lead to root issues."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To encourage blooming, ensure the cactus receives adequate humidity and appropriate seasonal care.",
        "Providing a period of cooler temperatures in winter can help stimulate flowering in spring."
