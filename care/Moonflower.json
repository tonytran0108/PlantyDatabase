    "name": "Moonflower",
    "climate": [
        "Moonflowers thrive in warm climates, typically preferring tropical or subtropical regions.",
        "They can tolerate some variations in temperatures but grow best where summers are consistently warm.",
        "In cooler climates, moonflowers can be grown as annuals but need protection from frost.",
        "Humidity levels can affect growth, with moderate to high humidity being most favorable."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Moonflowers require full sunlight to bloom prolifically, ideally for at least six hours a day.",
        "While they can tolerate partial shade, this might lead to fewer blooms and slower growth.",
        "In consistently sunny conditions, moonflowers establish robust vines and produce abundant flowers.",
        "If grown indoors or in less sunny areas, consider supplementing with artificial grow lights."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Moonflowers need consistent watering during their growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it is crucial to allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.",
        "During the hottest months, increase watering frequency to compensate for increased evaporation.",
        "Reduce watering in cooler months, as the plant's growth slows down and water needs decrease."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining soil is essential for moonflowers, with a preference for sandy loam or rich organic soil.",
        "While not extremely picky about soil pH, moonflowers flourish in soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH.",
        "Adding organic matter like compost can enhance soil fertility and improve drainage for moonflowers.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils unless amended, as these can retain too much moisture and hinder root development."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Moonflowers contain compounds that can be toxic if ingested by humans or pets, causing symptoms like nausea.",
        "The seeds and parts of the plant are especially poisonous, necessitating caution if planted near children or animals."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune moonflowers regularly to encourage bushier growth and extend the blooming period throughout the season.",
        "Train the vines to climb on trellises or other supports for optimal space utilization and best visual effect."
