    "sunlight": ["Morel mushrooms grow best in dappled sunlight or partial shade.", "They are often found in wooded areas where sunlight is filtered through trees.", "Direct sunlight is not preferred, as it can dry out the mushrooms.", "Areas with moderate sunlight exposure are generally most suitable."],
    "watering": ["Natural rainfall is typically sufficient for morel mushrooms in the wild.", "They require a moist environment during their growing season.", "Overwatering can be detrimental, leading to rotting of the mushrooms.", "In cultivation, ensuring the soil retains some moisture is important."],
    "soil": ["Morel mushrooms prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter.", "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels in the soil are ideal for growth.", "They often thrive in recently disturbed soil, such as after forest fires.", "Presence of decaying wood in the soil can create a favorable environment."],
    "toxic": ["While morels are edible, they must be cooked thoroughly to remove toxins.", "Eating raw morels can cause stomach upset and other symptoms."],
