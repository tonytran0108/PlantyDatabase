    "climate": [
        "Mums thrive in moderate climates that experience mild to warm temperatures.",
        "They are not well-suited for regions with harsh or extreme climates.",
        "Optimal growing conditions include temperatures between 60°F to 70°F.",
        "Avoid regions with excessive humidity as mums prefer dryer climates."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Mums prefer full sun exposure to achieve the best flowering results.",
        "They require at least six hours of direct sunlight each day for growth.",
        "Partial shade conditions can be tolerated but may reduce blooming.",
        "Inadequate sunlight can result in leggy growth and fewer blooms."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water mums consistently to keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy.",
        "Deep watering is preferred over frequent light watering for root development.",
        "During hot weather, mums may require more frequent watering sessions.",
        "Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogged soil, which can harm roots."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A rich, well-draining soil mix is ideal for growing healthy mums.",
        "Soil should be amended with compost to enhance nutrient availability.",
        "Avoid clay-heavy soils that can retain too much moisture and cause rot.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH level in the soil is preferred by mums."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Mums contain pyrethrins which can be toxic to cats, dogs, and horses.",
        "Ingestion of the plant may lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and incoordination.",
        "Keep pets away from mum plants to prevent potential toxic exposure.",
        "Consult a veterinarian if ingestion by pets is suspected."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pinch back stems during growth season to encourage bushier plants.",
        "Deadhead spent blooms to extend the flowering period and improve appearance.",
        "Apply mulch around the base to conserve moisture and hinder weed growth.",
        "Support taller varieties to prevent flopping over during flowering season."
