    "name": "Myrtle",
    "climate": [
        "Myrtle plants thrive in a warm Mediterranean climate and prefer mild winters.",
        "They do well in regions with hot, dry summers similar to their native habitats.",
        "Temperatures should ideally stay above freezing to support evergreen foliage.",
        "In colder climates, myrtle should be grown indoors or in shelters."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Myrtle requires a location with full sunlight for optimal growth and flowering.",
        "A minimum of six hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight daily is recommended.",
        "Partial sunlight will reduce flowering and may cause leggy, weak growth.",
        "Too much shade can hinder its health, affecting the plant's vigor over time."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent moisture is important, but the soil must not become waterlogged.",
        "Regular, moderate watering during dry spells helps maintain healthy foliage.",
        "Allow the top layer of soil to dry out between thorough watering sessions.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage is available."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining soil that includes sand or gravel for optimal root aeration.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH soil blend aids in nutrient absorption and growth.",
        "Soil should retain moisture without becoming compacted to support root health.",
        "Inadequate drainage can stifle the plant, leading to stunted development."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning post-blooming encourages denser growth and healthier foliage.",
        "Winter protection for outdoor plants in cold areas prevents frost damage.",
        "Insect infestations can be managed with organic or chemical treatments.",
        "Myrtle plants can be shaped into ornamental topiaries with careful trimming."
