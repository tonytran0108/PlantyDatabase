    "climate": [
        "Oak mistletoe thrives in a moderate climate where temperatures do not drop too low.",
        "It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers.",
        "The plant prefers environments that provide a balance between sunlight and humidity.",
        "This mistletoe can tolerate a range of climatic conditions, making it quite adaptable."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Oak mistletoe requires partial to full sunlight to grow and photosynthesize effectively.",
        "It commonly grows on host trees in open areas with unobstructed sunlight.",
        "Although adaptable, it cannot thrive in areas with constant deep shade or indoor settings.",
        "Exposure to natural sunlight is crucial for its parasitic lifecycle and propagation."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "As a parasitic plant, oak mistletoe obtains its water from the host tree's vascular system.",
        "It does not require direct watering but depends heavily on the health of the host tree.",
        "Ensuring the host tree is well-hydrated indirectly supports the mistletoe's needs.",
        "In drought conditions, both the host tree and the mistletoe may suffer reduced vigor."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Being parasitic, oak mistletoe does not have specific soil requirements since it doesn't grow in soil.",
        "The health of the host tree, however, may depend on the soil's nutrient and moisture levels.",
        "Host trees can be found in a variety of soils, provided they support healthy tree growth.",
        "Soil conditions indirectly affect mistletoe's growth through the host tree's root systems."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Oak mistletoe is considered toxic if ingested by humans and some animals.",
        "The plant contains viscotoxin, which can cause adverse effects if consumed.",
        "Symptoms of mistletoe poisoning may include stomach pain, diarrhea, and slow heart rate.",
        "Caution is advised to prevent children and pets from consuming the berries or leaves."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning of infested branches can help control mistletoe spread.",
        "Monitor the health of host trees to prevent mistletoe from overwhelming them.",
        "Consider professional removal if the mistletoe infestation is severe.",
        "Some birds help propagate mistletoe; managing wildlife can limit its spread."
