    "name": "Old Man",
    "climate": [
        "Old Man Cactus thrives in regions with warm, arid conditions, similar to desert environments.",
        "It prefers climates where there is plenty of sunshine and low humidity to prevent rot.",
        "The plant can tolerate temperatures that drop slightly below freezing but requires protection from severe cold.",
        "In its native habitat, the climate is typically dry and hot, with minimal rainfall throughout the year."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "This cactus needs full sun and should be placed in a location with direct sunlight for strong growth.",
        "Growers should ensure the plant receives at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "It is best suited for sunny, south-facing windowsills if grown indoors to mimic its natural light conditions.",
        "Access to plenty of light helps maintain the plant's health and allows it to develop its distinguishing features."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Watering should be sparse, allowing the soil to dry out completely between each watering session.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; hence, it's important to avoid waterlogged conditions.",
        "During winter, reduce watering significantly as the plant enters a dormant state and requires less moisture.",
        "In their natural habitat, these cacti receive minimal rainfall, so err on the side of underwatering indoors."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Use well-draining cactus soil mix, often made of sand, perlite, or pumice, to provide the best conditions.",
        "The soil should retain some moisture but drain quickly to prevent root rot caused by excess water.",
        "Adding gravel or small stones to the soil can improve drainage and mimic natural growing conditions.",
        "The ideal soil for the Old Man Cactus is one that emulates its arid desert environment, promoting aeration."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To maintain its distinctive appearance, keep an eye out for pests like mealybugs that may hide in the hairy surface.",
        "When handling, use thick gloves or tongs to avoid injury from the sharp spines hidden beneath the hair."
