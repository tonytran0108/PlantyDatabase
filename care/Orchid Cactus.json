    "name": "Orchid Cactus",
    "climate": ["Orchid cacti thrive in warm temperatures suitable for tropical plants.", "They require relatively high humidity levels to grow healthily.", "Being native to jungles, they do not tolerate cold climates or frost.", "A stable, moderate climate without extreme fluctuations is essential."],
    "sunlight": ["Orchid cacti prefer bright, indirect sunlight to avoid leaf scorch.", "They can adapt to lower light conditions but may bloom less profusely.", "Natural filtered sunlight as found under tree canopies suits them well.", "Avoid placing them in direct, intense sunlight to prevent damage."],
    "watering": ["Water orchid cacti thoroughly, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings.", "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure pots have good drainage.", "Adjust the frequency of watering based on the season and environment.", "During winter, reduce watering as the plant goes into a dormant phase."],
    "soil": ["A well-draining potting mix designed for epiphytic cacti is ideal.", "Incorporating organic material like orchid bark helps retain necessary moisture.", "The soil should be light and airy, preventing compactness around the roots.", "Avoid heavy soils which could retain too much water and cause root issues."],
    "toxic": ["Some species of orchid cacti may cause mild discomfort if ingested by pets."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["To encourage blooming, provide a cooler period in winter with less watering."]
