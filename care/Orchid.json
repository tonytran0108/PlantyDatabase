    "sunlight": ["Orchids need bright, indirect sunlight for healthy blooms and growth.", "Too much direct sunlight can cause orchid leaves to burn and damage.", "A north or east-facing window is optimal to provide orchids with adequate light.", "In low light conditions, orchids might not flower as effectively."],
