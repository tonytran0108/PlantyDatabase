    "climate": [
        "Owl Eyes prefers a warm and temperate climate, thriving in conditions where the temperature doesn't drop too low.",
        "This plant is well-suited to subtropical regions where there is minimal risk of frost or extended cold periods.",
        "In cooler climates, it might require some protection during the colder months or be grown indoors.",
        "Humidity levels should be moderate, as extreme dryness can affect Owl Eyes' growth and leaf health."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Owl Eyes plants enjoy bright, indirect sunlight, which helps them maintain vibrant foliage.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so they are best placed in a location where they receive filtered light.",
        "If grown indoors, placing them near a window with sheer curtains can mimic their preferred sunlight exposure.",
        "In low light conditions, Owl Eyes may exhibit slower growth and less vibrant foliage, so adequate light is important."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Ensure regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist without being waterlogged.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so proper drainage is essential to prevent water buildup.",
        "During warmer months, more frequent watering might be necessary, but allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings.",
        "In winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant's growth slows and it requires less moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Owl Eyes thrives in well-draining soil, rich in organic matter to provide adequate nutrients.",
        "A mixture of peat, perlite, and a standard potting mix can create an ideal growing medium.",
        "Soil should retain some moisture but not remain soggy, to support healthy root development.",
        "Regularly check the soil for compaction and refresh with new potting mix as needed to ensure aeration."
