    "name": "Papaya",
    "climate": ["Papaya thrives in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures remain warm throughout the year.", "It is sensitive to frost and cold climates and requires a warm environment to grow successfully.", "Regions with consistent temperatures above 70°F (21°C) are ideal for papaya cultivation.", "Humidity levels can also affect growth, with higher humidity being beneficial in tropical climates."],
    "sunlight": ["Papaya plants require full sunlight exposure to produce abundant fruit.", "They need at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day.", "Shade can significantly reduce papaya growth and fruit production.", "Sunlight is critical, particularly during the early stages of papaya plant development."],
    "watering": ["Consistent moisture is crucial for papaya plants, but they do not tolerate waterlogging.", "Papayas need frequent watering, especially during dry periods, to maintain healthy growth.", "While papayas require substantial water, it's important to ensure soil drains well to prevent root rot.", "Ensuring an adequate balance between moisture and drainage promotes optimal growth and fruit production."],
    "soil": ["Papaya plants grow best in well-draining, nutrient-rich soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.", "Sandy loam soils with adequate organic matter content are highly suitable for papaya cultivation.", "Soil should be fertile and loose to allow roots to expand and access nutrients efficiently.", "Avoid heavy clay soils as they can retain water and restrict root growth, causing poor plant health."],
    "toxic": ["Papaya seeds contain small amounts of a substance called benzyl isothiocyanate, which can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Mulching around the base of papaya plants can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature, promoting better growth."]
