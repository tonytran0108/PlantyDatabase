    "climate": [
        "The Parachute Plant thrives in warm environments, making it suitable for growing indoors where temperatures are fairly consistent.",
        "A dry climate is ideal for the Parachute Plant as it mimics its natural habitat, so avoid placing it in high humidity areas.",
        "It prefers temperatures ranging between 70°F to 85°F, replicating the warmth of its native regions.",
        "Rapid temperature changes should be avoided, as they can stress the Parachute Plant and hinder its growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "The Parachute Plant requires bright light to flourish, though it should be indirect to prevent leaf scorching.",
        "A spot near a south-facing window is optimal, providing plenty of natural light throughout the day.",
        "It can tolerate low light for short periods but needs bright, indirect light for optimal health.",
        "Filtered light is ideal, mimicking the dappled sunlight of its native environments, preventing excessive exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Allow the soil of the Parachute Plant to dry out between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot, which the Parachute Plant is susceptible to.",
        "Watering during the active growing season, spring through early fall, should be more frequent.",
        "In winter, reduce watering significantly, only moistening the soil occasionally to mimic dormancy."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining potting mix is crucial for the Parachute Plant to prevent waterlogging.",
        "Cactus or succulent soil mixes are ideal, as they are formulated to support such drought-loving plants.",
        "The soil should be rich in inorganic matter like perlite or sand to improve drainage and aeration.",
        "Compacted or poor-draining soils must be avoided as they can lead to root system issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "The Parachute Plant, when ingested, can cause discomfort and is considered toxic to pets such as dogs and cats.",
        "Symptoms of toxicity may include vomiting, diarrhea, or other digestive disturbances."
