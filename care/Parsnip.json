    "name": "Parsnip",
    "climate": [
        "Parsnips thrive in temperate climates with cool, long growing seasons.",
        "They are best suited for regions with mild summers and cold winters.",
        "Parsnips require a growing season of at least 100 to 120 days without extreme heat.",
        "Avoid climates with high humidity and frequent heavy rainfall for optimal growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Parsnips require full sun exposure for optimal growth, ideally 6 to 8 hours a day.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade but will produce smaller roots as a result.",
        "Ensure they get ample sunlight especially in the morning to avoid humidity-related diseases.",
        "Avoid planting in areas shaded by trees or large structures for best outcomes."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent moisture is essential; water deeply once a week if rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Parsnips prefer well-drained soil to avoid root rot, so avoid waterlogging the soil.",
        "Mulching can help to retain soil moisture during drier periods in their growing season.",
        "Water more frequently in dry periods but ensure the soil is not soggy or overly wet."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Parsnips grow best in deep, light, sandy loam with good drainage properties.",
        "The soil should be free of stones and clods to prevent root distortion.",
        "They require a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0 for optimal nutrient absorption.",
        "Enrich the soil with organic matter to boost fertility and support healthy root development."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To improve germination, soak seeds for 24 hours before sowing them.",
        "Parsnip seeds have a short viability period; use fresh seeds for best results.",
        "Thin seedlings to 3 to 4 inches apart to allow enough room for root growth.",
        "Protect young plants from pests such as carrot flies using row covers."
