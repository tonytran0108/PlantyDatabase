    "name": "Passionflower",
    "climate": ["Passionflowers thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, where the temperatures are warm year-round.", "They can also grow in temperate regions but require protection during cold winters.", "High humidity levels help them flourish, and they prefer a climate with consistent rainfall.", "Some species are more tolerant of cooler climates, but they generally do best in warm environments."],
    "sunlight": ["Passionflowers require full sun to thrive and produce abundant blooms.", "They can tolerate partial shade, but flowering may be reduced without adequate sunlight.", "These plants prefer at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight a day for optimal growth.", "If grown indoors, they should be placed near a south-facing window for maximum light exposure."],
    "watering": ["Passionflowers need regular watering, but the soil should not be constantly soggy or waterlogged.", "It is important to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during the growing season.", "During the winter months, the watering frequency can be reduced as the plant's growth slows.", "Using mulch can help retain soil moisture and keep roots healthy and hydrated."],
    "soil": ["Passionflowers prefer well-draining soil rich in organic matter for nutrient availability.", "A soil pH level between 6.0 and 7.5 is ideal for the healthy growth of passionflowers.", "Adding compost or other organic amendments can improve soil fertility and structure.", "They thrive in loamy or sandy soils, but will struggle in heavy clay or poorly drained conditions."],
    "toxic": ["Passionflower leaves and roots can be mildly toxic if ingested in large quantities.", "The fruits of most species are edible, though some can cause stomach discomfort.", "Caution is advised when consuming passionflower products as they may interact with medications.", "It is best to consult with a healthcare provider before using passionflower for medicinal purposes."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Pinching off tips can encourage bushier growth and more flowers on passionflowers.", "Provide a support structure like a trellis, as passionflowers are climbing plants.", "Pruning in early spring can help control the size and shape of the plant for better management.", "Watch for pests like aphids and spider mites, which can harm the plant and require prompt action."]
