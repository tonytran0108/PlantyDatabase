    "name": "Pawpaw",
    "climate": [
        "Pawpaw trees thrive in temperate climates with cold winters and warm summers.",
        "They prefer areas with distinct seasons, which helps in fruit development.",
        "Regions with a climate that resembles their native habitat in the eastern U.S.",
        "They're not drought-tolerant and require consistent moisture for good growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Pawpaw trees grow best in full sun, providing consistent fruit production.",
        "Young plants benefit from partial shade as full sun can scorch them initially.",
        "They naturally grow as understory trees, adapting to varying light conditions.",
        "As they mature, they become more tolerant of direct sunlight exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering ensures healthy growth, especially in dry periods.",
        "Avoid waterlogging; well-drained soil is essential for proper plant health.",
        "Water deeply once per week, allowing the topsoil to dry in between sessions.",
        "Mulching helps retain moisture and maintain consistent soil hydration."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Pawpaw trees require rich, fertile soil for optimal growth and fruiting.",
        "Soil should be well-draining with a slightly acidic to neutral pH balance.",
        "Amend poor soils with organic matter to enhance fertility and structure.",
        "Clay or sandy soils must be improved, using compost, for successful cultivation."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Pawpaw seeds and bark contain toxic compounds and should not be ingested.",
        "Consuming large quantities of the seeds can lead to digestive discomfort.",
        "Handling of seeds should be done with care to avoid accidental ingestion.",
        "The fruit, however, is safe to eat when ripe and has no toxic effects."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Protect new plants from extreme cold; they need gradual acclimatization.",
        "It's beneficial to hand-pollinate flowers, enhancing fruit set and yield.",
        "Maintain a mulch layer to suppress weeds and maintain even soil moisture.",
        "Consider planting grafted varieties for faster fruit production and reliability."
