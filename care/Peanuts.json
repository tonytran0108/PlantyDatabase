    "name": "Peanuts",
    "climate": [
        "Peanut plants thrive in warm climates with temperatures between 70°F and 85°F.",
        "They require a long frost-free growing season of at least 120 to 150 days.",
        "Peanuts prefer arid or semi-arid climates with minimal humidity.",
        "High humidity can promote diseases in peanut plants, so dry climates are ideal."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Peanuts need full sun exposure, receiving at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.",
        "The plants perform best in fields that are not shaded by buildings or tall trees.",
        "Ample sunlight helps peanuts in developing their pods underground efficiently.",
        "Without sufficient sunlight, peanut plants may grow weak and produce fewer pods."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Peanut plants require consistent moisture but cannot tolerate waterlogged soil.",
        "Regular watering is essential, especially during pod development and flowering.",
        "Irrigation systems help in maintaining appropriate moisture levels without overwatering.",
        "A lack of water can severely impact yield, especially during crucial growing stages."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Peanuts grow best in well-drained sandy loam soil rich in organic matter.",
        "The soil should be loose enough to allow the pegs to penetrate and develop pods.",
        "Maintaining a soil pH between 5.8 and 6.2 is ideal for optimal peanut growth.",
        "Heavy clay or compacted soils can restrict root growth and reduce the yield."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Peanut plants are generally not toxic, but peanuts can cause severe allergies in some individuals."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Rotate peanut crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and improve soil health."
