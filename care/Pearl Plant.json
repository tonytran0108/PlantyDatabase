    "name": "Pearl Plant",
    "climate": ["The Pearl Plant thrives well in a warm and dry desert climate, resembling its native environment.", "This plant is adaptable to arid climates, requiring minimal humidity for optimal growth.", "A Mediterranean-type climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters is suitable.", "Pearl Plant is suitable for USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12, which have warm conditions."],
    "sunlight": ["Pearl Plant requires bright, indirect sunlight for optimal health and growth.", "Direct sunlight should be avoided as it can scorch the leaves and stunt growth.", "If indoors, a south or east-facing window provides the best light conditions.", "It can adapt to lower light conditions, but growth will be slower and color may fade."],
    "watering": ["Water the Pearl Plant sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.", "Overwatering is a common issue, leading to root rot; ensure pot has good drainage.", "During winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant enters a dormant phase.", "Use the 'soak and dry' method where soil is thoroughly moistened and allowed to dry."],
    "soil": ["A well-draining soil mixture with sand or perlite is essential for Pearl Plant health.", "Cactus or succulent potting soil can be used to ensure proper drainage and aeration.", "Avoid heavy or clay soils that retain water, as these may cause root rot in the plant.", "The soil pH should be neutral to slightly acidic, around 6.0 to 7.0, for best results."],
    "toxic": ["Pearl Plants are mildly toxic to pets and humans, causing stomach upset if ingested.", "They can cause skin irritation on contact, so handling with care is advised."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Consider repotting every couple of years to refresh soil and provide space for growth.", "Rotate the plant periodically to ensure even growth and prevent it from leaning towards light."]
