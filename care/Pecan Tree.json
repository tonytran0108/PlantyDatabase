    "name": "Pecan Tree",
    "climate": [
        "Pecan trees thrive in regions with a warm, humid climate that supports their growth.",
        "Ideal climates for pecan trees include the southeastern United States with mild winters.",
        "These trees require a long growing season, with hot summers to produce healthy nuts.",
        "Pecan trees can tolerate short periods of drought but prefer areas with consistent rainfall."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Pecan trees need full sunlight exposure for at least six hours a day to flourish.",
        "They grow best in open areas where they are not shaded by other larger trees.",
        "Consistent sunlight helps in the production of quality nuts and healthy foliage.",
        "Pecan trees located in shaded areas will have stunted growth and lower nut yields."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Initially, young pecan trees require frequent watering to establish a strong root system.",
        "Mature trees need deep watering during prolonged periods of drought stress.",
        "Consistent watering is crucial during the nut filling stage to avoid crop loss.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage in the soil."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Pecans grow optimally in deep, well-drained soils like loamy or sandy soils.",
        "Soil pH should ideally be between 6.0 and 7.0, ensuring nutrient availability.",
        "Avoid soils that are compacted or prone to waterlogging to prevent root diseases.",
        "Incorporating organic matter can enhance soil fertility and improve pecan productivity."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly monitor for pests such as aphids and mite infestations on pecan trees.",
        "Pruning is necessary to maintain tree shape and promote healthy nut development.",
        "Apply a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to support tree health.",
        "Consider cross-pollination with other pecan varieties to enhance nut yield and quality."
