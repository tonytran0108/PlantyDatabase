        "Avoid placing peonies in climates that are too hot as they can struggle.",
        "Moderate humidity levels are best, as too much moisture can lead to rot."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Peonies require full sun exposure for at least six hours each day.",
        "In hotter climates, partial afternoon shade can help prevent heat stress.",
        "Without adequate sunlight, peonies may produce fewer or no blooms.",
        "Ensure the planting area receives morning sun to promote good growth."

    "watering": [
        "Peonies need regular watering, especially during dry spells to thrive.",

        "Avoid waterlogging as it can cause root rot; well-drained soil is crucial.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and keep roots cool and moist."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Peonies prefer well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic matter.",
        "A neutral to slightly alkaline pH level in the soil aids their growth.",
        "Compacted or heavy clay soils should be amended to improve drainage.",
