    "name": "Petunia",
    "climate": [
        "Petunias thrive in temperate climates, where the temperature stays mild.",
        "They prefer a climate without extreme heat or frost to bloom fully.",
        "Subtropical climates can support petunia growth, but with some challenges.",
        "Petunias are not suitable for very cold or extremely dry climates."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Petunias require full sunlight for at least six hours each day to thrive.",
        "Partial shade may result in fewer blooms and leggy growth in petunias.",
        "Sunlight ensures vibrant and frequent flowering in healthy petunias.",
        "Avoid deep shade entirely, as it can significantly hinder their growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Petunias need consistent watering, but the soil should not become waterlogged.",
        "Soil should remain evenly moist; dry soil can hinder bloom production.",
        "Ensure adequate drainage, especially after heavy rains, to prevent root rot.",
        "During hot weather, increase watering frequency to keep them hydrated."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Petunias prefer well-drained soil with a slight acidic pH for optimal growth.",
        "Soil needs to be rich in organic matter to supply ample nutrients.",
        "Loamy soil with added compost can significantly improve growth outcomes.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soil, which retains too much water and can harm roots."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead petunias regularly to encourage more blooms and extend the blooming period.",
        "Fertilize petunias every couple of weeks during the growing season for best results."
