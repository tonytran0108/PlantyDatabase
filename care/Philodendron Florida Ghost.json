    "name": "Philodendron Florida Ghost",
    "climate": [
        "This plant thrives best in a warm and humid climate. Ideally, temperatures should be maintained between 65°F to 80°F, as this mimics its tropical origins.",
        "Philodendron Florida Ghost is sensitive to cold temperatures. It is not frost-tolerant and should be protected from temperatures below 50°F to prevent damage.",
        "A high humidity environment is preferable for this plant. Humidity levels preferably should be above 60% for optimal growth and health.",
        "It is generally grown indoors in most areas except for tropical climates. Avoid placing it in drafty areas or near cold windows."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "This plant does well in bright, indirect sunlight. Exposure to direct sunlight can scorch its leaves and cause them to turn yellow.",
        "Fluorescent lighting is also adequate for its growth, making it suitable for indoor office environments with artificial lighting.",
        "Low light tolerance means it can survive in less ideal light conditions, but optimal growth and coloration occur in better lighting.",
        "Establish a consistent light source, as sudden changes can stress the plant and affect its health and growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Philodendron Florida Ghost requires regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged to avoid root rot.",
        "Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering again. Overwatering can lead to severe root problems and decline.",
        "Reduce watering during the colder months as the plant's growth rate slows down and it requires less moisture.",
        "Always use well-draining pots and check for proper drainage to prevent any risk of standing water at the root level."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining potting mix is essential for this plant. Using equal parts of peat, perlite, and pine bark can optimize drainage and aeration.",
        "Avoid using heavy soil mixtures that retain too much moisture. Compact or clay-like soils may lead to waterlogged roots.",
        "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral (pH 5.6 to 7.0), promoting nutrient availability and healthy growth.",
        "Repotting every couple of years with fresh soil can help refresh nutrient supply and improve soil structure for the plant."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Philodendron Florida Ghost is toxic to pets and humans if ingested. It contains calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation and discomfort."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "For enhanced foliage coloration, adjust lighting conditions to encourage the ghostly white shades typical of new leaves."
