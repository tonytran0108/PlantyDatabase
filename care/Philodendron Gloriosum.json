    "soil": ["A well-draining soil mix with rich organic material is preferred for growth.", "It benefits from soil mixtures containing peat, perlite, and orchid bark.", "The soil should retain some moisture but also offer enough aeration for roots.", "Ensure that the pot provides adequate drainage holes to prevent water accumulation."],
