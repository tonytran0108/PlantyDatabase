    "sunlight": [
        "Philodendron Rio thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and should be protected from direct sun rays.",
        "Natural filtered light works best, as too much direct sunlight can scorch its leaves and cause damage.",
        "A well-lit room with indirect sunlight helps the plant maintain its variegated leaf patterns effectively.",

    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water the Philodendron Rio when the top inch of soil feels dry, being careful not to overwater.",
        "Consistent watering is key, but the plant should not sit in water, which can lead to root rot.",
        "Reduce watering frequency during the winter months when the plant's growth slows down naturally.",
        "Ensuring proper drainage is crucial, as excess water can harm the plant’s health significantly."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining, peat-based potting mix is ideal to help Philodendron Rio thrive indoors.",
        "The soil should retain moisture without becoming waterlogged, which could lead to root issues.",
        "Incorporate perlite or orchid bark into the soil mix to enhance drainage and aeration functions.",
        "Regularly refresh the top soil layer to supply nutrients as the plant grows and develops over time."
