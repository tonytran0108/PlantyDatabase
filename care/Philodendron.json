    "name": "Philodendron",
    "climate": ["Philodendrons thrive in tropical climates with high humidity and warmth.", "They prefer temperatures ranging from 65°F to 85°F for ideal growth.", "These plants can tolerate occasional temperature drops, but not for prolonged periods.", "Avoid cold drafts and sudden temperature changes, which can affect health."],
    "sunlight": ["Philodendrons prefer bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth.", "Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to burn or become discolored over time.", "They can adapt to lower light conditions but may grow more slowly.", "An east-facing window is typically suitable for most Philodendron species."],
    "watering": ["Philodendrons like consistently moist soil, but avoid overwatering.", "During the growing season, water the plant when the top inch of soil is dry.", "Reduce watering frequency in the winter when the plant's growth slows down.", "Make sure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating."],
    "soil": ["Use a well-draining potting mix to ensure excess moisture doesn't cause root rot.", "A combination of peat, perlite, and pine bark works well for these plants.", "The soil should have good aeration to allow the roots to breathe properly.", "Avoid compact soils that retain too much water and hinder drainage."],
    "toxic": ["Philodendrons are toxic to pets and humans if ingested, causing irritation.", "Symptoms of toxicity include oral irritation, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Wipe leaves occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust and allow proper photosynthesis.", "Pruning can encourage bushier growth and remove any dead or yellowing leaves."]
