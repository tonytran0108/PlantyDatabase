    "name": "Pineapple Tomato",
    "climate": ["The pineapple tomato plant thrives well in warm climate conditions that mimic subtropical regions.", "Ideal temperatures for growing pineapple tomatoes range from 70°F to 85°F during the day.", "Pineapple tomatoes require a long growing season, so regions with a long summer are suitable.", "They do not tolerate frost well and need protection if unexpected cold occurs."],
    "sunlight": ["Pineapple tomatoes need full sun exposure to grow optimally, requiring at least 6-8 hours daily.", "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggy plants with reduced fruit production.", "Position in a location where they can capture maximal sunlight throughout the day.", "Filtered sunlight or partial shade can hinder the tomato's growth and yield."],
    "watering": ["Consistent and even watering is required to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.", "Inadequate watering can result in fruit cracking or blossom end rot.", "Water deeply at the plant base rather than overhead to prevent foliar diseases.", "Mulching can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature around the plant."],
    "soil": ["They prefer well-draining soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8 for optimal growth.", "Soil rich in organic matter like compost will support healthier plant development.", "Good air circulation in soil is important, which requires avoiding compaction.", "Raised beds or container planting can improve soil quality and drainage."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Staking or caging is recommended to support the vigorous growth and heavy fruit load.", "Pruning lower leaves can improve air circulation and reduce risk of disease spread."]
