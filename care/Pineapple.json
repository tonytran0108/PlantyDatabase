        "High humidity is beneficial, typically needing between 60% and 70% humidity.",
        "Cold and frost are detrimental; they need protection from temperatures below 50°F."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Pineapple plants require full sunlight for optimal growth and fruit production.",
        "They need at least six hours of direct sunlight each day to thrive.",
        "In areas with intense sun, provide filtered light to prevent leaf scorch.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but too much shade hampers fruit development."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Pineapples like well-distributed watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between.",
        "Over-watering can lead to root rot; water sparingly in cooler months.",
        "Consistent moisture levels are important but avoid waterlogging the soil.",
        "Use a balanced approach; too much or too little water affects growth negatively."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Pineapples prefer well-draining, sandy loam soil with good aeration.",
        "Soil should be rich in organic matter to provide essential nutrients.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH, between 4.5 and 6.5, is ideal for growth.",
        "Ensure the soil retains moisture but does not become compacted over time."
