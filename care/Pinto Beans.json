    "name": "Pinto Beans",
    "climate": ["Pinto beans thrive in warm climates where temperatures range from 70°F to 85°F.", "These beans need at least 100 frost-free days to reach maturity.", "Pinto beans are not frost-tolerant and should be planted after the last spring frost.", "The ideal growing conditions include moderate humidity levels to avoid disease."],
    "sunlight": ["Pinto beans require full sunlight for optimal growth and production.", "They need at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day.", "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor growth and lower yields.", "Pinto beans planted in shaded areas may develop mold or mildew due to higher moisture levels."],
    "watering": ["Pinto beans need consistent watering, especially during flowering and pod formation.", "Avoid waterlogging, as it can lead to root rot; well-drained soil is essential.", "A deep watering schedule once a week helps promote healthy root development.", "It's crucial to let the soil dry between watering to prevent fungal diseases."],
    "soil": ["Pinto beans prefer well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter.", "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, around 6.0 to 7.0.", "Heavy clay soils should be amended with compost for better drainage.", "Compacted or poorly draining soils can cause root diseases and poor growth."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Do not plant pinto beans in the same soil repeatedly without crop rotation to prevent soil depletion and disease build-up.", "Regularly check for pests such as aphids and beetles, which can damage the plants.", "Using a mulch can help to preserve moisture and suppress weed growth.", "Pinto beans benefit from support structures if they grow too tall, preventing stem breakage."]
