    "name": "Polyanthus",
    "climate": ["Polyanthus plants thrive in cool climates where temperatures are mild.", "They prefer environments with high humidity and consistent moisture to flourish.", "Cold climates are ideal as they do not tolerate extreme heat very well.", "They can handle light frost, making them suitable for temperate regions."],
    "sunlight": ["Polyanthus grow best in partial to full shade, avoiding harsh direct sunlight.", "They require indirect light to develop vibrant blooms and maintain health.", "Early morning sun or dappled shade throughout the day is ideal for them.", "Avoid positioning in strong afternoon sunlight which can scorch the leaves."],
    "watering": ["Maintain consistent moisture in the soil to prevent it from drying out completely.", "Water regularly, ensuring that the soil is kept evenly moist but not waterlogged.", "During dry periods, increase watering frequency to sustain plant health.", "Avoid letting the soil dry out between waterings to prevent plant stress."],
    "soil": ["Polyanthus prefers rich, well-draining soil that retains some moisture.", "Use a mixture of loam and organic matter to enhance soil quality and texture.", "The soil should be slightly acidic to neutral, with a pH of 6 to 7 for optimal growth.", "Soil should allow for good air circulation around roots to prevent rot issues."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Regular deadheading of spent blooms encourages continuous flowering.", "Mulching around the base helps retain soil moisture and regulate temperature."]
