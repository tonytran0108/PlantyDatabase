    "name": "Potato",
    "climate": [
        "Potatoes prefer a temperate climate with moderate temperatures, ideally between 60°F to 70°F during the day.", 
        "They can tolerate cooler temperatures, but frost can significantly harm potato plants.", 
        "A consistent climate with few fluctuations is ideal for healthy potato growth.", 
        "Regions with well-distributed rainfall also support excellent potato cultivation."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Potato plants require full sunlight for a significant part of the day to thrive and produce.",
        "At least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight is essential for adequate potato growth.",
        "Shady conditions can lead to poor tuber development and lower yield.",
        "Consistent sunlight exposure helps in the efficient photosynthesis of potato plants."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Potatoes need regular watering, ensuring the soil is consistently moist but never waterlogged.",
        "Overwatering can lead to tuber rot, while underwatering can stunt plant growth.",
        "Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are efficient for maintaining ideal moisture levels.",
        "During the growing season, especially in arid regions, they may require extra water."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Potatoes thrive in loose, well-drained soil rich in organic matter with good aeration.",
        "Slightly acidic soil, with a pH of 5.0 to 6.5, is preferred for optimal potato development.",
        "Compacted or heavy clay soils can hinder tuber growth and lead to poor yields.",
        "Amending soil with compost or well-rotted manure enhances nutrient content and structure."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Potato leaves and stems contain solanine, which is toxic and should not be eaten."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "When growing potatoes, regularly mound soil around the base to ensure tuber coverage and prevent greening."
