    "name": "Prairie Smoke",
    "climate": [
        "Prairie Smoke thrives in temperate climates with distinct seasons, experiencing warm summers and cold winters.",
        "It naturally occurs in dry, open prairies with well-drained soils, adapting to a variety of temperate climates.",
        "This plant is well-suited for regions with moderate rainfall, relying on seasonal changes for optimal growth.",
        "Adaptable to climates that experience snowfall in winter, Prairie Smoke benefits from a dormant cold season."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Prairie Smoke requires full sunlight for optimal flowering, thriving in open and unshaded areas.",
        "While it can tolerate partial shade, too much shade may reduce flowering and affect growth.",
        "This plant benefits from at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day for best performance.",
        "Ideally suited to open prairie environments, it adapts well to bright, sunny locations in gardens."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Prairie Smoke is drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established in the landscape.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; it's crucial to let the soil dry out between waterings.",
        "During prolonged dry spells, occasional deep watering may be beneficial to support plant health.",
        "Water regularly during the first growing season to establish deep, extensive root systems."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "This plant prefers well-drained soils, often found in sandy or gravelly prairie environments.",
        "Though adaptable, it thrives in soils that are not waterlogged and have good drainage capacity.",
        "Prairie Smoke tolerates a range of soil pH levels, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline conditions.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils unless amended to improve drainage, as poor drainage can be detrimental."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To maintain healthy growth, consider removing spent flowers to prevent excessive seeding in small gardens.",
        "In its native habitats, natural wildfires help manage competition; consider periodic light pruning to mimic this effect.",
        "Mulching around the base of the plant can prevent weed growth and retain moisture in the soil.",
        "Dividing clumps every few years can rejuvenate older plants and promote healthier flowering."
