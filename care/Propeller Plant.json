        "It is well-suited to Mediterranean climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are mild.",
        "The plant can tolerate coastal climates where humidity levels can be higher than in deserts.",
        "This succulent prefers areas with low rainfall, characteristic of desertlike environments."

    "sunlight": [
        "The propeller plant requires full sunlight to partial shade for optimal growth and health.",
        "Direct sunlight for a majority of the day is ideal, particularly during morning hours.",
        "It can adapt to intense afternoon sun but benefits from some shading in extremely hot climates.",
        "Indoors, a south-facing window offers the propeller plant adequate sunlight exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water the propeller plant sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's best to err on the side of underwatering.",
        "During the growing season, which is spring and summer, a moderate watering routine is suitable.",
        "In the winter months, watering should be reduced significantly to prevent excessive moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "A well-draining soil mix is essential, often comprising sand, perlite, and gravel.",
        "The propeller plant benefits from cactus or succulent potting mix for adequate drainage.",
        "Soils that retain too much moisture should be avoided to prevent root rot.",
        "Adding inorganic materials to the soil will help imitate the plant's natural arid habitat."
