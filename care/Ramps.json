    "name": "Ramps",
    "climate": [
        "Ramps thrive in temperate climates with cold winters and warm, humid summers.",
        "The plant requires a distinct change in seasons to break dormancy and grow properly.",
        "A climate that provides a natural canopy, like a deciduous forest in spring, is ideal.",
        "Ranges such as those experienced in the northeastern US are perfect for ramps."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Ramps prefer partial shade, mimicking conditions of a forest floor.",
        "Direct sunlight is not suitable; they flourish under the dappled light of spring.",
        "This plant thrives best with dappled sunlight that filters through tree leaves.",
        "In early spring, ramps benefit from indirect sunlight before trees fully leaf out."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Ramps require consistently moist soil, replicating a forest undergrowth setting.",
        "The plant does well with regular watering, ensuring the soil remains damp.",
        "Avoid letting the soil dry out completely; consistent moisture is key for growth.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided, but ample humidity supports ramp development."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Rich, loamy soil creating a nutrient-dense environment mirrors a natural habitat.",
        "A well-draining soil composition is needed to prevent waterlogging issues.",
        "High organic matter in the soil supports the necessary nutrients for ramps.",
        "An acidic to neutral pH level is ideal for ramps to absorb nutrients efficiently."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Ramps typically require several years to establish before a mature harvest.",
        "Sustainable harvesting is vital; only take a small portion to prevent depletion.",
        "Regular application of organic mulch helps retain moisture and mimic forest litter.",
        "Avoid planting in direct grassy areas; competition with grass can hinder growth."
