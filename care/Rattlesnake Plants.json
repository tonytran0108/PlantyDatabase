    "climate": [
        "Rattlesnake plants thrive in warm and humid environments, resembling tropical rainforest conditions.",
        "These plants prefer temperatures between 65°F to 75°F, they do not tolerate cold climates or frost.",
        "Consistent humidity levels are important, making them suitable for bathrooms or kitchens with steam.",
        "Avoid placing them in drafty areas as sudden temperature changes can hinder their growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Rattlesnake plants grow well in moderate to low indirect light, avoiding direct sunlight.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch their leaves, so they thrive in rooms with filtered sunlight.",
        "Provide bright, indirect light for optimal growth, but they can adapt to lower light conditions.",
        "Ensure they are placed near a window with sheer curtains to filter the incoming sunlight."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "These plants require consistent watering to keep the soil moist but not soggy.",
        "Water them once the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, avoiding waterlogged roots.",
        "In winter, reduce the frequency of watering to prevent overwatering, which can cause root rot.",
        "Use lukewarm water and ensure thorough drainage, as they prefer humidity and moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Rattlesnake plants thrive in well-draining, rich organic potting soil mixed for tropical plants.",
        "The soil should retain some moisture while allowing excess water to drain freely.",
        "Adding perlite or pumice can enhance drainage and prevent water from accumulating.",
        "A mixture of peat-based potting mix, orchid bark, and perlite is suitable for these plants."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly misting the leaves can help maintain the humidity levels they require.",
        "Clean foliage with a damp cloth to remove dust and promote healthy photosynthesis.",
        "Consider using a humidity tray with pebbles and water to enhance the surrounding humidity.",
        "Rotate the plant occasionally to ensure even growth and exposure to light."
