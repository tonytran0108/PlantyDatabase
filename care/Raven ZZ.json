        "Does not tolerate frost or very cold temperatures, keep above 50°F.",
        "Adaptable to dry indoor environments, as it is drought tolerant.",
        "Humidity levels are not a major concern, but avoid overly damp conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can damage the leaves.",
        "Can tolerate lower light conditions, making it a versatile houseplant.",
        "Avoid placing in full sun to prevent leaf burn and color fading.",
        "Artificial lighting conditions are usually adequate for growth."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water thoroughly, but allow the soil to dry out between waterings.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot; ensure pot has proper drainage.",
        "In the winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant's growth slows.",
        "Check the top 2-3 inches of soil to ensure dryness before watering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Requires well-draining soil, such as a cactus or succulent mix.",
        "A mix with sand or perlite can improve drainage, preventing root rot.",
        "Avoid heavy, water-retentive soils to ensure proper aeration.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral for optimal growth."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "The Raven ZZ is toxic if ingested, due to the presence of calcium oxalate.",
        "Caution is advised when having this plant around pets and small children."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Avoid frequent repotting; ZZ plants prefer to become root-bound.",
        "Clean leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and promote photosynthesis."
