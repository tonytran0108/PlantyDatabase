    "name": "Red-Twig Dogwood",
    "climate": ["Red-Twig Dogwood thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and mild winters, making it suitable for a range of environments.", "It can tolerate a variety of weather conditions but performs best in areas where it gets ample rainfall and moderate temperatures.", "This plant is adaptable to different climates but will thrive most in regions that do not experience extreme aridity or heat.", "In colder climates, it may require some protection from harsh winds to prevent branch damage during the winter months."],
    "sunlight": ["Red-Twig Dogwood grows best in full sun conditions, requiring at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.", "While it can grow in partial shade, optimal branch and color development occur with full sunlight exposure.", "Ensure the plant is not shaded by taller trees to maximize the vibrant red coloration of its stems, especially in winter.", "In heavily shaded areas, the growth may become leggy, and the color of the stems might be less pronounced."],
    "watering": ["Red-Twig Dogwood requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.", "Overwatering should be avoided as it can lead to root rot; ensure proper drainage is in place to prevent standing water.", "During its initial growth period, more frequent watering may be necessary to establish strong roots.", "Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but will benefit from supplemental watering during prolonged dry spells."],
    "soil": ["This plant prefers well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter, which helps retain moisture while providing nutrients.", "It can adapt to a variety of soil types, from sandy to clay, as long as the soil is not excessively compacted.", "For optimal growth, ensure the soil is slightly acidic to neutral, with a pH range of approximately 5.5 to 7.0.", "Amending soil with compost or peat moss can improve nutrient content and ensure adequate aeration and drainage."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["To maintain its vibrant color and shape, consider annual pruning, removing about one-third of the oldest stems to encourage new growth.", "Mulching around the base of the plant can help retain moisture and suppress weeds, contributing to healthier growth."]
