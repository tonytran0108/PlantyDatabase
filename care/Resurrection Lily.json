    "name": "Resurrection Lily",
    "climate": ["The Resurrection Lily thrives in temperate climates with distinct seasons.", "Warm summers and cold winters are ideal for Resurrection Lilies to bloom well.", "They can adapt to cooler climates but prefer not to be in frost-prone areas.", "Hot and dry climates may require additional care to ensure bulb survival."],
    "sunlight": ["Resurrection Lilies prefer full sun exposure for optimal flowering.", "Partial shade is tolerated but may result in fewer blooms.", "They should receive at least six hours of sunlight per day for best growth.", "Avoid deep shade as it can significantly reduce flowering success."],
    "watering": ["Water regularly during the active growing season to keep soil moist.", "Reduce watering during dormancy as the bulbs are restocking energy.", "Avoid waterlogged conditions which can cause bulb rot.", "Moderate watering is needed; too much or too little can impact health."],
    "soil": ["Well-draining soil is crucial to prevent bulb rot in Resurrection Lilies.", "A mix of sand, loam, and humus-rich soil helps retain the right moisture.", "They thrive in soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH level.", "Amending the soil with organic compost can enhance growth outcomes."],
    "toxic": ["All parts of the Resurrection Lily, especially the bulbs, are toxic if ingested.", "They contain alkaloids that can cause nausea or vomiting in pets and humans.", "Care should be taken to plant them away from areas where children play.", "Pets such as cats and dogs are especially at risk if they ingest any part."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Dividing bulbs every few years helps prevent overcrowding and promotes healthy blooms.", "In colder climates, apply a layer of mulch in fall to protect the bulbs over winter.", "Deadheading spent flowers can direct energy back into bulb growth.", "Avoid planting in areas prone to standing water, especially in the dormant season."]
