    "name": "Royal Poinciana",
    "climate": [
        "Royal Poinciana thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, where the temperature is warm.",
        "It prefers a humid climate, often found in island regions where humidity levels are high.",
        "This plant does well in areas with dry winters and wet summers, typical of some tropical regions.",
        "Avoid planting in areas with cold temperatures as it is not frost-tolerant at all."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun exposure is required for optimal blooming and tree health.",
        "It needs at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight for best flowering results.",
        "Inadequate sunlight can result in poor growth and limited flowering potential.",
        "Partial shade may be tolerated but can significantly reduce flowering efficiency."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water regularly during the growing season, especially in hot and dry climates.",
        "Ensure the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged to prevent root rot.",
        "Reduce watering in the winter months when the tree is not actively growing.",
        "Mulching can help retain moisture during drier periods or extreme heat spells."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining loamy or sandy soils with adequate organic content for nutrients.",
        "It thrives best in slightly acidic to neutral pH soils, which promotes better growth.",
        "Compact, clay-heavy soils may hinder growth; consider soil amendments if necessary.",
        "Avoid soils with poor drainage as the roots are susceptible to rot in wet, boggy conditions."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune regularly to maintain shape and clearance, especially in urban settings.",
        "Protect from strong winds which can break branches due to its wide canopy.",
        "Watch for pests like caterpillars, and apply appropriate treatments if necessary.",
        "During flowering, too much overhead watering may damage the vibrant blossoms."
