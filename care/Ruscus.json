    "name": "Ruscus",
    "climate": ["Ruscus plants thrive best in temperate climates where they can receive moderate temperatures and humidity levels.", "They prefer environments that do not experience extreme cold or hot conditions, typically found in Mediterranean regions.", "These plants are accustomed to a climate with mild winters and cool summers, making them suitable for hardiness zones between 7 and 9.", "Ruscus can tolerate some climatic variations, but they grow optimally in stable environments without significant temperature fluctuations."],
    "sunlight": ["Ruscus plants prefer partial shade to full shade, making them ideal for woodland or shaded garden areas.", "They can tolerate low light environments, which is why they are often used as indoor plants in areas with indirect light.", "Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to scorch or become discolored, so it's best to avoid placing them in very sunny spots.", "Filtered sunlight or dappled shade, such as that received under a canopy of trees, is ideal for their growth."],
    "watering": ["Ruscus requires moderate watering; the soil should be kept consistently moist but not waterlogged.", "It's important to allow the soil to dry out slightly between watering to avoid root rot, especially in less humid climates.", "In indoor environments, reduce watering frequency during the winter months when plant growth slows down.", "Overwatering is a common issue for Ruscus, so drainage should be ensured to prevent standing water around the roots."],
    "soil": ["A well-draining soil mix is crucial for Ruscus, ideally one that retains some moisture while allowing excess water to escape.", "They thrive in soil composed of organic materials, such as peat moss, leaf mold, or compost, which provide nutrients.", "The ideal soil pH for Ruscus is slightly acidic to neutral, typically ranging from 6.0 to 7.0.", "It's beneficial to use a potting medium that facilitates air circulation around the roots to promote healthy plant growth."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Ruscus is relatively low-maintenance but benefits from occasional fertilization during the growing season for optimal health.", "Pruning can be done to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth, ideally in the springtime after new growth appears."]
