    "name": "Russian Sage",
    "climate": [
        "Russian Sage thrives best in temperate regions with dry, arid conditions.",
        "It's well suited to areas with long, hot summers and limited rainfall.",
        "This plant can endure some cold, but prefers warmer climates overall.",
        "In extremely humid environments, it might be more prone to disease."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun is ideal for Russian Sage, allowing it to bloom best.",
        "Plant in an open area receiving at least six hours of direct sunlight.",
        "Partial shade is tolerated but may result in sparser flowering.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggy growth and weak stems."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Russian Sage prefers well-drained soil to prevent root rot issues.",
        "Once established, it is drought-tolerant and needs minimal water.",
        "Overwatering can be detrimental, especially in heavy soils.",
        "Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions."

    "soil": [
        "This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils.",
        "Sandy or gritty soils are preferred, mimicking their native habitat.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain moisture and inhibit root growth.",
        "Amending soil with gravel can improve drainage for Russian Sage."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning back the stems in early spring encourages denser growth.",
        "Avoid fertilizing as this can reduce flowering and lead to legginess."
