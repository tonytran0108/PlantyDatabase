    "name": "Saskatoon Serviceberry",
    "climate": ["The Saskatoon Serviceberry thrives best in temperate climates where it can experience a range of seasons.", "In colder climates with harsh winters, the Saskatoon Serviceberry can still survive, though it may require some protection.", "It is native to North America and prefers areas where it receives moderate rainfall throughout the year.", "While adaptable, it does not do well in extremely hot and humid tropical climates."],
    "sunlight": ["Saskatoon Serviceberry plants thrive in full sun environments, receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.", "They can also grow in partial shade, but this may result in reduced fruit production and growth rate.", "To ensure optimal health, choose a planting location that maximizes sun exposure, especially in the morning.", "Avoid locations that are completely shaded throughout the day as this will not support healthy plant development."],
    "watering": ["The Saskatoon Serviceberry requires moderate watering, ensuring the soil is kept consistently moist but not waterlogged.", "During extended periods of drought, increase watering frequency to support fruits and overall plant vitality.", "It is important to reduce watering in late summer as the plant naturally prepares for dormancy in autumn.", "Over-watering can lead to root rot, so ensure the soil has proper drainage to prevent water accumulation."],
    "soil": ["Saskatoon Serviceberry prefers well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter to support its growth.", "The plant can tolerate a range of soil types, including sandy and clay soils, if drainage is adequate.", "A slightly acidic to neutral pH level ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for optimal nutrient uptake.", "Incorporating compost or well-rotted manure before planting can improve soil fertility and structure."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Regular pruning helps maintain a desirable shape and promotes new growth for better fruit production.", "Mulching around the base of the plant helps retain soil moisture and reduces competition from weeds.", "Monitor for common pests such as spider mites and aphids, which can be controlled with natural predators or sprays.", "In colder regions, applying a layer of mulch in fall can help insulate roots during harsh winter conditions."]
