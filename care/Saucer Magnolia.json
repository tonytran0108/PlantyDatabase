        "It's beneficial to apply mulch to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Saucer magnolias prefer slightly acidic, well-drained soil for healthy growth.",
        "Loose, loamy soil rich in organic matter supports better nutrient uptake.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain water and cause the roots to suffocate.",
        "Soil amendments with peat moss or compost can improve soil quality effectively."
