        "Sesame plants require a climate with stable temperatures and minimal temperature fluctuation.",
        "Humidity should be low to moderate; excessive humidity might lead to plant diseases."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Sesame plants need full sun to grow, ideally receiving direct sunlight for most of the day.",
        "In locations with plentiful sunlight, sesame will produce a higher yield and healthier seeds.",

        "Consistent and intense sunlight helps sesame plants to mature and develop efficiently."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Sesame plants prefer moderately dry conditions; overwatering can damage the plants.",
        "Allowing the soil to dry between waterings helps prevent root rot and fungal issues.",
        "Infrequent but deep watering encourages sesame plants to develop deeper root systems.",
        "Water carefully to ensure that water is absorbed by the soil and does not stay on the foliage."

    "soil": [
        "Sesame grows best in well-drained sandy loam soils that do not retain excess moisture.",
        "Soil pH should be between 5.5 and 8.0; neutral to slightly alkaline soils are ideal.",
        "Ensure that the soil is loose and friable, allowing roots to penetrate and grow without obstruction.",
        "Adding organic matter like compost can improve soil structure and boost nutrient availability."
