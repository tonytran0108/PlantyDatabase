    "climate": [
        "Shamrocks thrive in cool climates where the temperature does not exceed 75°F.",
        "They prefer environments with moderate humidity and gentle breezes.",
        "A temperate climate with night temperatures slightly cooler than day is ideal.",
        "Shamrocks are less tolerant of extreme temperature variations and dry air. "
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Shamrocks prefer indirect sunlight or partial shade for optimal growth.",
        "Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, leading to brown spots and leaf drop.",
        "Bright, filtered light is ideal, particularly near an east or north-facing window.",
        "Too much shade can hinder flowering and make the plants leggy and weak."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water evenly and consistently, allowing some drying between each watering.",
        "Overwatering may lead to fungal growth and root rot in shamrocks.",
        "Reduce watering frequency during dormancy periods in the summer months.",
        "Ensure the pot has proper drainage to prevent water-logging and root issues."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Shamrocks require well-draining soil, ideally a potting mix with perlite or sand.",
        "A rich organic matter content is beneficial for their growth and health.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels are preferred for optimal nutrient uptake.",
        "Heavy, clay-based soils should be avoided as they trap excess moisture."

    "toxic": [
        "Shamrocks contain oxalate compounds which are toxic to pets if ingested."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Shamrocks often enter dormancy; reduce watering and store in a cool place."
