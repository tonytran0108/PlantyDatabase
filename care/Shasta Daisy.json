    "name": "Shasta Daisy",
    "climate": [
        "Shasta daisies thrive in a temperate climate with cool to moderate temperatures.",
        "They prefer a climate with well-defined seasons, including a cold winter period.",
        "These daisies are suitable for regions with mild summers and not extreme heat.",
        "They can withstand sporadic cold spells but are not suited for tropical climates."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Shasta daisies require full sunlight to achieve optimal growth and flowering.",
        "They should be planted where they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.",
        "Partial shade can lead to reduced flowering and less vigorous plant growth.",
        "Full sunlight not only aids in flowering but also enhances plant health and vigor."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Shasta daisies need moderate watering, preferring soil that drains well.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the soil dries slightly between waterings.",
        "In general, water them deeply once a week, especially during hot spells.",
        "During winter, less frequent watering is needed as the plant is semi-dormant."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "These daisies favor well-drained soil with a neutral to slightly acidic pH.",
        "Soil should be enriched with organic matter to support healthy root development.",
        "Sandy or loamy soils tend to work best, providing both nutrients and drainage.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils which can retain water and cause drainage issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadheading spent blooms encourages further flowering throughout the season.",
        "Divide clumps every few years to maintain vigor and prevent overcrowding.",
        "In colder climates, a layer of mulch can help protect the roots in winter.",
        "Support taller varieties with stakes to prevent lodging during windy conditions."
