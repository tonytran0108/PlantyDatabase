    "name": "Showy Stonecrop",
    "climate": ["Showy Stonecrop, also known as Sedum spectabile, tends to thrive in temperate climates and can handle moderate temperature fluctuations.", "This plant prefers climates that have distinct seasons, particularly with cold winters and warm summers.", "A typical growing environment for Showy Stonecrop includes temperate zones where frost is common during late fall and winter.", "While adaptable, it is best suited to regions that do not experience extreme tropical climates or excessive humidity."],
    "sunlight": ["Showy Stonecrop plants require full sun to grow optimally and develop their best colors.", "It prospers in locations where it receives at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.", "Weak or indirect sunlight will lead to leggy growth and less vibrant leaf coloration.", "While the plant can tolerate partial shade, flowering may be reduced in lower light conditions."],
    "watering": ["The watering needs of Showy Stonecrop are low, making it drought-tolerant and ideal for dry gardens.", "Watering should be done sparingly; overwatering can lead to root rot and general plant health decline.", "A deep watering once every one to two weeks is sufficient—contingent on the climate conditions.", "During periods of extended drought, slightly increased watering may be necessary for optimal growth."],
    "soil": ["Showy Stonecrop prefers well-draining soil – sandy or gravelly types are ideal to prevent waterlogging.", "While it can tolerate poor soil conditions, the addition of mulch can help maintain soil temperature and moisture.", "For optimal growth, enriched soil with good drainage properties ensures better root development.", "Heavy clay soils should be avoided or amended with organic matter for improved drainage."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["While generally low-maintenance, removing spent flower heads can promote additional blooming and maintain tidiness.", "Applying a light fertilizer in the spring can help promote healthier growth and robust flowering.", "Cut back the stems in the late fall or early spring to either clean up old growth or prepare for new growth.", "Ensure adequate space around each plant to encourage air circulation and reduce the potential for mildew."]
