    "climate": [
        "Snow peas thrive best in a cool climate, ideally between 13°C and 18°C.",
        "They do not handle frost well, so planting after the last frost is advisable.",
        "A temperate climate is suitable for snow peas, especially for a spring crop.",
        "Humidity levels should generally be low to moderate for optimal growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Snow peas require full sun exposure for at least six to eight hours a day.",
        "Partial shade is tolerable, but it can impact the yield and growth rate.",
        "Ensure your snow peas are in a location that receives unfiltered sunlight.",
        "Avoid planting in fully shaded areas as plants will not grow well without enough light."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry spells or hot weather.",
        "Avoid over-watering as snow peas do not thrive in waterlogged conditions.",
        "Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on rainfall and temperatures.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and maintain a balanced water level."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained soil with a pH level of 6.0 to 7.5 is optimal for snow peas.",
        "Loam or sandy soil enriched with organic matter suits snow peas well.",
        "Good soil aeration is essential to prevent root rot and promote health.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils as they can lead to waterlogging and poor growth."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular harvesting is important to encourage continued production of pods.",
        "Provide support such as trellises since snow peas have climbing tendencies."
