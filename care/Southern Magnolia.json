    "name": "Southern Magnolia",
    "climate": [
        "The Southern Magnolia thrives in humid subtropical climates where it benefits from hot summers and mild winters.",
        "It prefers regions with significant rainfall, typically favoring environments that provide abundant moisture throughout the year.",
        "While it can tolerate short periods of drought, prolonged dry spells are detrimental and can cause stress to the tree.",
        "This magnolia species can grow in USDA hardiness zones 7 to 9, ideally flourishing in environments that remain frost-free."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Southern Magnolias require full sun to grow best, needing at least six hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering.",
        "While they can adapt to partial shade conditions, insufficient light may result in fewer blooms and slower growth.",
        "These trees are often found in open spaces where ample sunlight can reach the canopy and encourage lush development.",
        "Ideal planting areas include spots that provide consistent sunlight exposure throughout the day, benefiting overall plant health."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential, particularly during the tree's initial years, to establish a strong and healthy root system.",
        "During dry months, additional watering may be necessary to maintain soil moisture, especially if natural rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Mature Southern Magnolias are somewhat drought-tolerant but still prefer consistent soil moisture for best growth.",
        "Ensure the planting site has adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can harm the roots and overall vitality."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Optimal soil conditions include a well-drained, rich loamy composition that provides essential nutrients to support growth.",
        "While Southern Magnolias can adapt to a wide range of soil types, including clay, they prefer slightly acidic to neutral pH levels.",
        "Regular amendments with organic compost or mulch can enhance soil fertility, promoting vigorous growth and lush foliage.",
        "Compacted or poorly draining soils should be avoided as they can lead to root rot and other growth-related issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning is best performed in late winter or early spring to shape the tree and remove any dead or crossing branches.",
        "Mulching around the base of the tree helps retain soil moisture and provides essential organic matter as it decomposes."
