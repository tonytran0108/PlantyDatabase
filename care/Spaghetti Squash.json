    "name": "Spaghetti Squash",
    "climate": [
        "Spaghetti squash thrives in a temperate climate with warm temperatures during the day and cooler nights.",
        "It requires a long growing season, typically around 100 days, in areas that do not have frost.",
        "Spaghetti squash grows well in areas with moderate humidity to prevent mildew and disease.",
        "It prefers climates where temperatures remain consistently warm, avoiding extremes of heat or cold."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Spaghetti squash requires full sunlight, needing at least six to eight hours of direct sun daily.",
        "While it can tolerate partial shade, optimal growth and yield are achieved with ample sunlight exposure.",
        "Positioning in an area with maximum sunlight ensures the fruit matures properly and develops full flavor.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor fruit development and reduced harvest quantity over the season."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is essential for spaghetti squash, especially during the fruiting stage.",
        "Aim to provide about one inch of water per week, adjusting based on rainfall and humidity levels.",
        "It is important to water at the base to avoid wetting the leaves and reduce risk of fungal diseases.",
        "Mulching can help retain soil moisture and reduce evaporation, sustaining plant hydration effectively."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Spaghetti squash prefers fertile, well-drained soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 6.8.",
        "The soil should be rich in organic matter, which can be increased with compost or aged manure.",
        "Good drainage is crucial to prevent root rot; sandy loam soils are ideal for proper growth.",
        "Before planting, working the soil to loosen compaction ensures healthy root development and stability."
