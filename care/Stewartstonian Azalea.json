    "name": "Stewartstonian Azalea",
    "climate": [
        "Stewartstonian Azaleas thrive in temperate climates with distinct seasons.",
        "They prefer a moderate climate where temperature variations are not extreme.",
        "In hot climates, providing shade and additional water helps sustain growth.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade climates better than full sun exposure."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Stewartstonian Azaleas grow well with partial to full sunlight exposure.",
        "They prefer morning sunlight with afternoon shade to prevent leaf scorch.",
        "Too much sunlight might cause stress, leading to leaf drop or discoloring.",
        "In cooler climates, these azaleas can tolerate more direct sunlight overall."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is crucial; the soil should be kept uniformly moist.",
        "Allow the top layer of soil to dry out slightly before watering again.",
        "Avoid waterlogging, as excessive moisture may lead to root rot in azaleas.",
        "In dry climates, additional watering support during dry months is necessary."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "They thrive in well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter and nutrients.",
        "The ideal soil pH for Stewartstonian Azaleas is between 4.5 and 6.0 for growth.",
        "Amend heavy clay soils or sandy soils to improve drainage and nutrient content.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain moisture and maintain soil temperature."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "All parts of azaleas are toxic if ingested, containing grayanotoxins.",
        "Ingesting even small amounts can cause vomiting, diarrhea, or lethargy.",
        "It's important to keep pets and small children away from these plants.",
        "Care should be taken when handling or pruning to avoid ingestion risks."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune after flowering to maintain shape without sacrificing blooms.",
        "Avoid planting too deep, as azaleas have shallow roots needing oxygen.",
        "In winter, protect from harsh winds with mulch or a windbreak structure.",
        "Fertilize with a specialized azalea or rhododendron fertilizer in spring."
