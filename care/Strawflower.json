    "name": "Strawflower",
    "climate": [
        "Strawflowers thrive in warm to hot climates, making them ideal for regions with temperatures ranging from 70 to 85°F.",
        "They can tolerate mildly humid conditions but prefer a dry climate, characteristic of Mediterranean regions.",
        "This plant is also suited for areas that experience little to no frost, as cold can damage or kill the plant.",
        "Strawflowers perform well in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 11, where the climate is conducive to their growth."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Strawflowers require full sunlight to bloom prolifically, absorbing direct sun for at least six hours per day.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but the bloom yield may be lower compared to plants grown in full sun.",
        "Excessive shade leads to leggy growth and fewer flowers, impacting the aesthetic value of the plants.",
        "Optimal growth and flower production occur when the plants are positioned in areas with bright, direct sunlight."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water strawflowers thoroughly but infrequently, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the soil drains well and remove any standing water promptly.",
        "During hot summer months, increase watering frequency to maintain soil moisture without waterlogging.",
        "Consistent watering helps in maintaining plant vigor, especially when strawflowers are grown in containers."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Strawflowers prefer well-draining soil with a sandy or loamy texture for optimal root development.",
        "The soil pH should be mildly acidic to neutral, ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 for best growth outcomes.",
        "Amend the planting area with organic matter or compost to improve nutrient availability and soil structure.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain water and can lead to root diseases, reducing plant longevity."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead spent flowers regularly to encourage new blooms and maintain plant appearance throughout the season."
