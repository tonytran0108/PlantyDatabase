    "name": "Sugar Cane",
    "climate": [
        "Sugar cane thrives in warm tropical climates with temperatures ideally between 20°C and 30°C for optimal growth.",
        "Regions with high humidity and consistent rainfall are best suited for sugar cane cultivation.",
        "The crop requires frost-free conditions throughout the year, making it unsuitable for temperate climate zones.",
        "Sugar cane grows best in areas that receive an annual rainfall of 1,200 to 1,500 millimeters distributed throughout the year."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Sugar cane requires full sunlight exposure for at least six to eight hours a day to achieve maximum growth potential.",
        "Extended shading or lack of sunlight can lead to reduced sugar content and hinder overall plant development.",
        "Maximizing light capture by ensuring an open planting area will help boost the photosynthetic efficiency.",
        "A location with direct, unfiltered sunlight is vital for achieving high yields in sugar cane agriculture."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent and adequate moisture is crucial; supplemental irrigation may be needed during dry spells.",
        "Over or under-watering can cause stress to the plant, impacting growth and sugar yield negatively.",
        "If natural rainfall is insufficient, a planned irrigation schedule can sustain healthy cane development.",
        "Efficient water management strategies ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged to avoid root rot."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Sugar cane thrives in well-draining soils with a good supply of organic matter for fertility.",
        "Loamy soils, rich in nutrients and slightly acidic to neutral in pH, are considered ideal for sugar cane.",
        "Heavy clay soils are not suitable due to poor drainage, but sandy loams can be conditioned to support growth.",
        "Proper soil preparation includes plowing and leveling to ensure even water distribution and root penetration."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly monitor for pests such as borers and aphids and apply appropriate pest control measures.",
        "Implement crop rotation and use of green manure to maintain soil fertility and reduce disease incidence."
