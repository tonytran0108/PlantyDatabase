    "name": "Sundew",
    "climate": ["Sundews thrive in temperate climates with mild summers and cool winters.", "They are found in diverse climatic regions, including wetlands and marshes.", "These plants adapt well to environments with high humidity levels.", "They can also be found in subtropical and Mediterranean climates."],
    "sunlight": ["Sundews require bright, indirect sunlight for robust growth.", "They can tolerate direct sunlight for a few hours, preferably morning sun.", "Insufficient light may result in weak, elongated growth.", "Light is crucial for them to produce the sticky substance to catch prey."],
    "watering": ["Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged.", "Use distilled or rainwater as tap water may harm the plant.", "Sundews prefer to sit in a water tray to maintain high humidity.", "Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely; this can harm the plant."],
    "soil": ["A mix of sphagnum moss and perlite or sand is ideal for sundews.", "The soil must be well-draining to prevent root rot from excess water.", "Avoid using nutrient-rich potting soil as it can harm sundews.", "A slightly acidic soil pH helps mimic their natural habitat."],
    "toxic": ["Sundew plants are generally non-toxic, but they can cause minor irritation."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Regularly remove dead leaves and stalks to prevent mold growth.", "Feeding is not necessary; they catch insects naturally.", "Avoid fertilizing; nutrients in fertilizers can harm sundews.", "Provide a rest period with cooler temperatures during winter."]
