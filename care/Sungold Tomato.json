    "climate": ["Sungold Tomatoes thrive best in a temperate climate where temperatures remain moderate without drastic fluctuations.", "These plants prefer a long growing season with warmth but can tolerate some cooler nights.", "Humidity levels should be balanced for Sungold Tomato plants to prevent fungal diseases.", "Avoid frost-prone climates as Sungold Tomatoes are sensitive to low temperatures."],
    "sunlight": ["Sungold Tomatoes require full sun, needing direct light for at least 6-8 hours a day.", "These plants should be placed in a location where they receive maximum sunlight exposure.", "Partial sunlight may hinder growth, leading to reduced fruit production quality.", "Ensure no obstructions to sunlight; consistent exposure is key for healthy growth."],
    "watering": ["Sungold Tomatoes need consistent watering, especially when establishing roots early in growth.", "Ensure soil remains moist but not waterlogged to prevent root rot and other issues.", "Deep watering at the base is optimal to encourage strong root system development.", "It's important to allow the top layer of soil to dry out slightly between waterings."],
    "soil": ["A well-draining soil is essential for Sungold Tomatoes to prevent water stagnation.", "These plants thrive in rich, organic soil that can maintain moisture effectively.", "Sandy loam is particularly preferred due to its balance of drainage and fertility.", "Add organic matter or compost to improve soil quality and support healthy growth."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Support the vines with trellises or cages to prevent sprawling and promote air circulation.", "Prune regularly to remove suckers and allow for better light penetration and air flow.", "Monitor for pests like aphids or whiteflies and treat promptly with organic solutions.", "Rotate crops annually to prevent soil nutrient depletion and reduce disease risk."]
