    "name": "Sweet Potato",
    "climate": [
        "Sweet potatoes thrive in tropical and subtropical regions, requiring warm temperatures.",
        "They need a frost-free growing period of at least 4 to 6 months to produce tubers.",
        "While they prefer temperatures between 21 and 26 degrees Celsius, they can tolerate slightly higher temperatures.",
        "Cooler climates can hinder their growth, so they are not suited for temperate zones."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Sweet potatoes require full sun to grow well, needing about 6 to 8 hours of sunlight daily.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor tuber formation and stunted plant growth.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but growth and yield will be adversely affected.",
        "Ensuring they receive ample sunlight helps maximize their productivity and health."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Consistent watering is crucial, especially during the establishment phase after planting.",
        "They require regular watering, particularly during dry spells, to prevent stress.",
        "Over-watering can lead to rot; ensure the topsoil dries out slightly between waterings.",
        "Once established, sweet potatoes can tolerate short periods of drought but not prolonged dry conditions."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "They prefer well-drained, sandy loam soils rich in organic matter to support their growth.",
        "Sweet potatoes are sensitive to poor drainage, and waterlogged conditions can cause tuber rot.",
        "Neutral to slightly acidic soil, with a pH of 5.8 to 6.2, is optimal for their growth.",
        "Heavy clay soils are not ideal unless raised beds or ridges can improve drainage."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly inspect the plants for pests like weevils and beetles that can damage tubers.",
        "Using black plastic mulch can help retain soil warmth and suppress weed growth effectively."
