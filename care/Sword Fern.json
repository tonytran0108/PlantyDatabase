    "name": "Sword Fern",
    "climate": ["Sword Ferns thrive in temperate climates where temperatures are moderate.", "They prefer high humidity environments, similar to their native rainforest habitats.", "These ferns are common in regions with mild summers and cool, wet winters.", "In colder climates, they may require protection during harsh winter months."],
    "sunlight": ["Sword Ferns prefer partial to full shade, making them ideal for forest understories.", "Direct sunlight can scorch their fronds, so they are best grown in dappled light.", "They thrive in shady spots where they receive sporadic sunlight filtering through trees.", "Avoid placing them in areas with prolonged direct sun exposure for best growth."],
    "watering": ["Sword Ferns need consistently moist soil, mimicking their natural rainforest habitat.", "During dry periods, extra watering may be needed to keep the soil from drying out.", "In cooler months, reduce watering to prevent waterlogged soil conditions.", "Always ensure the soil has good drainage to avoid water-related issues."],
    "soil": ["Sword Ferns grow best in well-drained, rich organic soil with good moisture retention.", "The preferred soil is loamy, rich in decomposed plant material similar to forest floors.", "They can tolerate sandy soil if it's amended with plenty of organic matter.", "Regular addition of mulch helps maintain soil moisture and enrich its quality."],
    "toxic": ["Sword Ferns are generally considered non-toxic to humans and pets."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Sword Ferns benefit from regular misting to maintain adequate humidity.", "Pruning dead or damaged fronds encourages new growth and maintains plant health.", "Mulch around the base of the fern to retain moisture and protect roots.", "Dividing the plant every few years prevents overcrowding and promotes vigorous growth."]
