    "name": "Taylor Juniper",
    "climate": [
        "Taylor Junipers thrive in temperate climates with mild winters.",
        "They can handle cold climates but may need winter protection in harsh zones.",
        "Warm climates support their growth, but extreme heat may cause issues.",
        "Ideally, they do well in regions with seasonal temperature variations."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Requires full sun exposure for at least six hours a day to thrive.",
        "While they can tolerate partial shade, it may impact growth rates.",
        "Optimal growth is achieved in areas without prolonged shading.",
        "Ensure they have unfiltered sunlight for dense foliage development."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Moderate watering is preferred; avoid waterlogged conditions to prevent rot.",
        "Newly planted junipers need consistent moisture until established.",
        "Once established, they are drought-tolerant and need less frequent watering.",
        "Ensure soil has sufficient drainage to prevent pooling and root issues."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-drained soils but can adapt to a variety of soil types.",
        "Sandy or gravelly soils are ideal, promoting excellent drainage.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils as they retain moisture and may cause root rot.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral pH levels promote optimal growth conditions."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Taylor Juniper may cause mild irritation if ingested by pets.",
        "Though not highly toxic, ingestion in large quantities can be harmful."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning helps maintain shape and promote bushier growth.",
        "Protect them from harsh winter winds which can cause desiccation."
