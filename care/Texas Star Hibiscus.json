    "sunlight": [
        "Full sun is preferred for optimal growth, requiring at least 6 hours daily.",
        "Partial shade may be tolerated, but can reduce blooming significantly.",
        "Direct sunlight encourages stronger, more vibrant flowering and foliage.",

    "watering": [
        "Water regularly during the growing season to maintain moist soil conditions.",
        "Ensure soil has good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot issues.",

    "soil": [
        "Prefers well-draining soil with a rich, organic matter content for nutrients.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH range is ideal for optimal plant health.",
        "Ensure soil composition supports moisture retention without becoming waterlogged.",
        "Use a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to promote vigorous growth."
