    "climate": ["Thyme thrives in a Mediterranean climate with warm and dry conditions.", "It can tolerate mild winters, but does not do well in very cold climates.", "Ensure the climate is not too humid as thyme prefers drier conditions.", "Regions with hot summers and cool, mild winters are ideal for thyme cultivation."],
    "sunlight": ["Thyme requires full sun exposure to grow optimally and produce flavorful leaves.", "It should receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day.", "Inadequate sunlight can lead to spindly growth and poor flavor.", "Thyme is well-suited to sunny outdoor gardens or bright indoor spots."],
    "watering": ["Thyme prefers well-drained soil and should not be overwatered.", "Water thyme thoroughly, but let the soil dry out completely between waterings.", "Overwatering can lead to root rot, which is detrimental to thyme's health.", "In dryer climates, it may require more frequent watering to maintain health."],
    "soil": ["Thyme grows best in well-drained soil with a sandy or rocky texture.", "It prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 8.0 for optimal nutrient uptake.", "Amend heavy clay soils with sand or gravel to improve drainage for thyme.", "Compacted, poorly-drained soils are unsuitable and should be avoided."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Prune thyme regularly to maintain a compact shape and encourage new growth.", "Cut back the stems by about a third in early spring to promote bushiness.", "Mulching around thyme can help retain soil moisture in extremely hot climates.", "Bring potted thyme indoors during extreme cold spells to protect it from frost damage."]
