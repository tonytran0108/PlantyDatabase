    "name": "Trout Lily",
    "climate": [
        "Trout Lilies thrive in temperate climate zones with cool spring conditions.",
        "They are often found in deciduous forests where they benefit from seasonal changes.",
        "These plants prefer a climate that provides a distinct winter season for dormancy.",
        "A humid environment with moist air is beneficial for their growth and development."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Trout Lilies grow best in partial shade, mimicking their natural woodland habitat.",
        "They can tolerate full shade and will thrive under a forest canopy with dappled light.",
        "Direct, harsh sunlight, especially during the hottest hours, can damage these plants.",
        "They require sufficient light in spring before trees leaf out, which aids in blooming."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Trout Lilies require consistently moist soil, especially during their growing season.",
        "These plants do not tolerate drought; dry conditions can harm their development.",
        "Watering should mimic natural rainfall patterns, providing moisture in early spring.",
        "Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root rot."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Trout Lilies prefer rich, organic soil that is high in humus and decomposed matter.",
        "They thrive in well-drained, fertile soil that retains moisture without becoming soggy.",
        "Acidic to neutral pH levels are ideal for their soil; excessive alkalinity isn't suitable.",
        "Soil should closely resemble leaf litter found in forests to meet their nutritional needs."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Trout Lily contains glycosides which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.",
        "Symptoms of toxicity might include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea if ingested.",
        "The plant is not typically harmful to humans in small quantities but is for pets.",
        "Ensure pets and livestock do not graze on Trout Lilies to prevent poisoning risks."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Plant Trout Lilies in areas where they can naturalize and establish over time.",
        "Avoid disturbing their roots; they can take several years to settle and bloom.",
        "Mulching with leaf mold can help maintain soil moisture and suppress weeds.",
        "Patience is needed as Trout Lilies may require several seasons to become established."
