    "name": "Tulip Tree",
    "climate": ["Tulip trees are well adapted to temperate climates where cold winters and warm summers are typical.", "This tree thrives in regions that experience distinct seasonal changes, including a dormant winter.", "It prefers regions with substantial rainfall during the growing season and a cold period for dormancy.", "Tulip trees are not suitable for tropical climates, as they require a period of cold dormancy to thrive."],
    "sunlight": ["Tulip trees require full sunlight to grow optimally, needing at least six hours of direct sun daily.", "They are not well suited to shady conditions; insufficient light can impede their growth and flowering.", "In natural environments, they often dominate the canopy layer, indicating their need for bright light.", "Ensure they are planted in a location that retains unobstructed access to sunlight throughout the day."],
    "watering": ["These trees prefer consistently moist soil; during dry conditions, additional watering may be necessary.", "The Tulip tree requires regular watering during its initial establishment period to support root development.", "Over-watering should be avoided, especially in poorly draining soil, to prevent root rot.", "Mulching around the base can help maintain soil moisture and reduce the watering frequency needed."],
    "soil": ["Tulip trees thrive best in deep, well-drained soils with plenty of organic matter.", "Slightly acidic to neutral pH soils are ideal, as overly alkaline soils can affect their health.", "Compacted soils can restrict root growth; thus, loamy or sandy-loam textures are preferred.", "Regular addition of compost or organic mulch can improve soil fertility and structure over time."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Tulip trees can be prone to pests like aphids and scale insects; regular monitoring is advised.", "Pruning should be done in late winter to early spring to promote healthy growth and shape.", "Avoid planting them near structures, as their large size and extensive roots require space.", "Frequent assessment for weak branches is important, especially to prevent breakage in storms."]
