    "name": "Tulips",
    "climate": [
        "Tulips thrive in temperate climates, which means they do well in areas with cold winters and mild summers.",
        "They require a period of dormancy during the winter, mimicking their native steppe climate conditions.",
        "In warmer climates, tulips may need to be pre-chilled to simulate their normal cold dormant period.",
        "Tulip bulbs can suffer in excessively hot and humid climates that lack distinct cold seasons."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Tulips prefer full sunlight for at least six hours a day to produce strong blooms.",
        "In hot climates, they benefit from some afternoon shade to prevent overheating.",
        "Adequate sunlight ensures vibrant colors and healthy growth for tulip flowers.",
        "Tulips planted in shaded areas may grow elongated stems as they reach for light."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Tulips need moderate watering; overwatering can lead to bulb rot.",
        "It's essential to maintain well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging that harms tulips.",
        "Once established, tulips are relatively drought resistant and require less frequent watering.",
        "Watering should be done at the base to keep foliage dry and prevent fungal infections."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Tulips require well-draining soil rich in organic matter to ensure healthy root development.",
        "A sandy or loamy soil type is ideal for tulips, allowing proper drainage and aeration.",
        "Soil should be neutral to slightly acidic, with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0, for optimal growth.",
        "Compacted or clay-heavy soil should be amended with organic matter to improve conditions."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Tulips contain alkaloids, making them toxic to pets if ingested and may cause stomach upset."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadhead tulip flowers after blooming to redirect energy back into the bulb for next year's growth."
