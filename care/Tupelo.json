    "sunlight": [
        "The Tupelo tree thrives in full sun, which is essential for its optimal growth and health.",
        "It can tolerate partial shade, but extended periods without sufficient sunlight can stunt its growth.",
        "For best results, ensure the tree is planted in a location that receives ample sunlight throughout the day.",
        "Positioning is crucial; avoid shaded spots by larger buildings or trees to ensure sunlight exposure."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Tupelo trees prefer consistently moist soil, as they are often found near water bodies in their natural environment.",
        "Regular watering is crucial, especially in dry periods, to maintain adequate moisture levels.",
        "Overwatering should be avoided as it can lead to root rot; balanced moisture is key.",
        "In areas with less natural rainfall, supplemental watering will be necessary to support tree health."

    "soil": [
        "The Tupelo tree adapts well to various soil types but thrives in acidic, rich, and well-drained soils.",
        "Soils with high organic content contribute to the healthy growth and resilience of the Tupelo tree.",
        "Compacted or poorly drained soils can hinder the development and restrict the tree’s rooting system.",
        "Amend the planting area with organic matter to enhance soil structure and nutrient profile for best outcomes."
