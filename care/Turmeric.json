    "name": "Turmeric",
    "climate": [
        "Turmeric is best grown in a tropical climate with high humidity levels.",
        "It thrives in temperatures between 20°C to 30°C, away from frost.",
        "A monsoon climate with distinct wet and dry seasons suits it well.",
        "Subtropical climates can also support its growth with proper care."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Turmeric requires full sun exposure for most of the day to thrive well.",
        "While it can tolerate partial shade, maximum sunlight is beneficial.",
        "Direct sunlight helps in proper photosynthesis and rhizome growth.",
        "Ensure the plant gets at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Turmeric plants need consistently moist soil, especially during growth.",
        "Avoid waterlogging, as soggy soil can lead to root and rhizome rot.",
        "Regular watering is needed during dry periods to sustain moisture.",
        "Irrigate the plant regularly but allow the topsoil to dry between watering."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Well-drained soil with rich organic matter is ideal for turmeric growth.",
        "Sandy loam soil helps in proper drainage and prevents waterlogging.",
        "Soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, around 4.5 to 7.5.",
        "Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil fertility."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Mulching the plant with organic material helps in moisture retention.",
        "Regular pruning of dry leaves and weeds ensures healthy growth.",
        "Providing support or staking may be necessary for vertical growth.",
        "Protect the plant during extreme temperatures using shade cloths."
