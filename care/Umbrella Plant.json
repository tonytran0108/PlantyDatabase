    "name": "Umbrella Plant",
    "climate": [
        "The Umbrella Plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures are consistently warm.",
        "It prefers a humid climate, which closely mimics its native environment in the rainforests.",
        "This plant does well in regions where the climate maintains moderate to high humidity levels year-round.",
        "In cooler climates, it should be kept indoors or in a greenhouse to meet its warmth needs."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Umbrella Plants grow best in bright indirect light similar to conditions found under a forest canopy.",
        "They can adapt to medium light levels, making them suitable for indoor environments away from direct sun.",
        "Exposure to direct sunlight can cause leaf burn, so it's best to avoid strong afternoon sun especially.",
        "It’s adaptable to lower light conditions but may grow slower or become leggy and require adjustment."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "The watering needs of an Umbrella Plant require the soil to be kept consistently moist without becoming waterlogged.",
        "It is important to let the top inch of soil dry out between watering to prevent root rot in the plant.",
        "During warmer months, the Umbrella Plant will need more frequent watering due to increased evaporation.",
        "In winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant's growth slows and water requirements decrease."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Umbrella Plants thrive in a well-draining potting mix that can retain moisture without being soggy.",
        "A good soil mix can include peat, perlite, and a loamy component for ideal water retention and aeration.",
        "The soil should offer slight acidity or neutrality to suit the plant's nutrient absorption requirements.",
        "Ensuring good drainage in the soil prevents common issues like root rot that the plant is prone to."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "The Umbrella Plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested by pets and humans.",
        "All parts of the plant are considered toxic and can cause irritation, swelling, and digestive issues if consumed."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regularly cleaning leaves with a damp cloth helps to prevent dust buildup and pests like spider mites.",
        "Humidity trays or frequent misting can help to maintain the ideal moisture level for healthier growth."
