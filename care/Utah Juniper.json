    "name": "Utah Juniper",
    "climate": [
        "Utah Juniper thrives in desert climates with low annual rainfall and dry air.",
        "It is well-adapted to hot summers and cold winters typical of mountainous regions.",
        "This plant can withstand temperatures ranging from well below freezing to over 100°F.",
        "It is ideally suited for arid environments with poor soil conditions."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Utah Juniper requires full sunlight for most of the day to grow effectively.",
        "This plant is adapted to thrive in regions with very high light intensity.",
        "Partial shade can stunt its growth, so optimal exposure to direct sunlight is crucial.",
        "In its native habitat, the plant receives unobstructed sunlight year-round."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Utah Juniper needs limited watering as it is highly drought-tolerant once established.",
        "Overwatering can be detrimental, making infrequent deep watering ideal for young plants.",
        "Natural rainfall is often sufficient, particularly in its native desert regions.",
        "Watering should be minimized during cooler months when the plant is dormant."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "It flourishes in well-drained sandy or rocky soils, which simulate its natural habitat.",
        "Poor, gravel-rich soils with little organic matter are ideal for Utah Juniper.",
        "The plant is adaptable to alkaline soils and can thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.",
        "Avoid heavy, clay-rich soils that retain water and hinder root development."
