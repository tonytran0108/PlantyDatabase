    "name": "Venus Fly Trap",
    "climate": [
        "Venus Fly Trap thrives best in a temperate climate where temperatures are mild.",
        "It does well in environments where there is high humidity consistently.",
        "The plant requires a period of dormancy with cooler temperatures in winter.",
        "A temperate to warm environment is best, avoiding extreme heat or cold."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "The Venus Fly Trap requires a lot of sunlight, ideally full sun exposure.",
        "Direct sunlight for at least four to six hours a day is beneficial for its growth.",
        "If grown indoors, placing the plant near a south-facing window works well.",
        "Supplemental lighting may be needed if natural light is insufficient."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid waterlogging which harms the roots.",
        "Distilled or rainwater is preferred as tap water can contain harmful minerals.",
        "Watering should be done often enough to keep the soil from drying out completely.",
        "A tray method can be used, ensuring the pot sits in shallow water constantly."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "The ideal soil mixture is a combination of sphagnum moss and sand or perlite.",
        "A nutrient-poor, acidic medium is essential to mimic its natural habitat.",
        "Avoid using nutrient-rich soil mixes which can harm the plant's health.",
        "The soil mixture should be well-draining to prevent root rot."
    ],
    "toxic": ["The Venus Fly Trap is generally non-toxic but can cause mild irritation if ingested by pets."],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Ensure dormancy is mimicked by reducing water and light in winter to maintain health."]
