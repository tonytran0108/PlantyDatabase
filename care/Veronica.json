    "sunlight": [
        "Veronica plants perform best when exposed to full sun for six to eight hours.",
        "They can also grow in partial shade but might result in fewer blooms.",
        "While tolerant to some shade, full sun ensures vibrant and prolific flowering.",
        "Avoid deep shade areas as insufficient sunlight can restrict flowering capacity."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is essential during the growing season to ensure optimal growth.",
        "The soil should be kept moist, but not waterlogged, to prevent root rot.",
        "A consistent watering schedule helps maintain the plant’s flowering potential.",
        "During dry spells, increase watering frequency to prevent dehydration."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Veronica plants prefer well-draining soil, rich in organic matter, for best results.",
        "Soil with good drainage prevents waterlogging and reduces the risk of root diseases.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH is optimal for Veronica’s nutrient uptake and health.",
        "Amending the soil with compost can enhance fertility and support vigorous growth."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular deadheading of spent flowers encourages continuous blooming.",
        "Be mindful of pests such as aphids and spider mites; use appropriate treatments.",
        "Consider dividing the plants every few years to maintain their vigor and health."
