    "climate": ["Wandflowers thrive best in temperate climates where temperatures are mild.", "They can adapt to subtropical areas, but may require additional care to flourish.", "In tropical climates, they need protection from excessive rain and heat.", "Cold climates may not be suitable unless protective measures are taken."],
    "sunlight": ["Wandflowers prefer full sun exposure for optimal blooming and growth.", "Partial shade is tolerable, but may result in fewer flowers.", "Ensure they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.", "Avoid excessive shade as it can lead to weak stems and poor flowering."],
    "watering": ["Wandflowers require moderate watering to maintain healthy growth.", "Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.", "Overwatering can cause the roots to become waterlogged and decay.", "In dry climates, they may need additional water during prolonged droughts."],
    "soil": ["Well-draining soil is essential to prevent waterlogged conditions.", "A sandy loam or soil supplemented with organic matter works well.", "Avoid heavy clay soils, as they can retain water and suffocate roots.", "Soil should be slightly acidic to neutral in pH for optimal health."],
