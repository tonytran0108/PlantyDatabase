    "name": "Water Lettuce",
    "climate": [
        "Water lettuce thrives in warm and humid tropical climates.",
        "It cannot survive frost and prefers temperatures between 70°F to 85°F.",
        "This plant prefers environments with high humidity and frequent rainfall.",
        "In cooler climates, it is often grown as an annual indoors or in greenhouses."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Water lettuce prefers bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth.",
        "This plant can tolerate some direct sunlight, especially in cooler regions.",
        "In very hot conditions, it is best to provide partial shade to prevent wilting.",
        "Too much direct sunlight can cause the leaves to bleach and become damaged."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water lettuce grows best in standing water, making ponds ideal.",
        "Ensure water levels remain consistent to support the plant's buoyancy.",
        "Mimic natural habitats by maintaining water levels of about 2 feet deep.",
        "In aquariums, provide adequate filtration to maintain clean water."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Water lettuce anchors best in soft, organic-rich aquatic substrates.",
        "While it floats, loose nutrient-rich soil in buckets helps root stability.",
        "Pond substrates with decomposed plant matter aid growth quality.",
        "In aquariums, specialized substrate for water plants boosts health."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Water lettuce is toxic to humans if ingested, causing severe reactions.",
        "It contains calcium oxalate crystals which can be harmful to pets.",
