    "name": "Watermelon",
    "climate": [
        "Watermelons thrive in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "They require a long growing season with plenty of sunshine; typically, 70 to 90 frost-free days.",
        "In cooler climates, watermelons can be grown in greenhouses to simulate the necessary warmth.",
        "They are sensitive to cold temperatures and can be damaged by frost, needing protection in early spring."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Watermelons need full sunlight, a minimum of 8 to 10 hours daily, to develop properly.",
        "Insufficient sunlight can lead to poor growth and reduced sweetness in the fruits.",
        "They are highly sun-loving plants and grow best in unobstructed sunlight areas.",
        "Plant in a location where they are not shaded by trees or buildings for optimum yield."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water regularly and deeply, especially during the dry season, to ensure healthy growth.",
        "The plants need an inch or two of water per week but reduce once fruit ripens.",
        "Avoid overhead watering; watering at the base reduces disease risk by keeping leaves dry.",
        "Mulching can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature during hot weather."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Plant watermelons in well-drained, sandy loam soil that warms up quickly.",
        "A soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8 is optimal for watermelon growth, aiding nutrient uptake.",
        "Incorporate organic material like compost to improve soil fertility and structure.",
        "Heavy, clay soils can hinder growth; raised beds or mounds can improve drainage."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Train vines to grow in one direction to prevent tangling and to optimize space.",
        "Prune excess flowers early to focus the plant's energy on fewer, larger fruits.",
        "Regularly check for pests and diseases, especially aphids and fungal infections.",
        "Rotate crops annually to prevent soil disease buildup and maximize plant health."
