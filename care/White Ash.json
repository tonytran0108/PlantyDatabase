    "name": "White Ash",
    "climate": [
        "White Ash trees thrive in climates that experience distinct seasonal changes, particularly with cold winters and warm summers.",
        "They are native to eastern and central North America, which includes humid continental and humid subtropical climates.",
        "This species prefers temperate climates where there can be a significant amount of annual rainfall for healthy growth.",
        "Although adaptable, White Ash trees struggle in extremely hot or arid environments, where moisture is scarce."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "White Ash trees require full sun to thrive and develop properly, typically needing at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.",
        "These trees perform best in open areas where they can receive unobstructed sunlight to support their growth and health.",
        "Although they can tolerate partial shade, full sunlight is essential for optimal photosynthesis and overall vitality.",
        "When planted in areas with adequate sunlight, White Ash trees tend to have better resistance to diseases and pests."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "White Ash thrives in well-watered soils, particularly during the growing seasons of spring and summer.",
        "Consistent moisture is important; however, the trees are somewhat drought-tolerant once they are well established.",
        "Overwatering or poorly draining soils can lead to root rot and other fungal diseases, so balance is key.",
        "In dry periods, especially in young trees, supplemental watering can promote healthy growth and foliage."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "White Ash trees prefer deep, rich soils that are well-drained and have a decent level of organic matter.",
        "They can grow in a variety of soil types, including loam, clay, and sand, but drainage is essential to avoid waterlogging.",
        "Slightly acidic to neutral soils with good fertility levels provide the best conditions for healthy tree development.",
        "Improving soil with compost or organic mulch can enhance water retention and nutrient availability for the trees."
    ],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Pruning White Ash trees during late winter or early spring can help maintain shape and remove diseased or weak branches.",
        "Monitoring for pest infestations such as the Emerald Ash Borer is vital, as it poses a significant threat to the species."
