    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "White firs grow best in full sun but can tolerate light shade in cooler areas.",
        "They need plenty of sunlight to maintain their shape and vibrant needle color.",
        "Avoid planting white firs in shady locations to prevent weak growth performance.",
        "Sufficient sunlight exposure is crucial for optimal growth and cone production."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "White firs need consistent moisture, particularly during dry spells or droughts.",
        "Ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged, as they do not tolerate soggy roots.",
        "Regular watering is essential during the initial years after planting a white fir.",
        "Established white fir trees can tolerate some drought but prefer regular moisture."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "White firs prefer well-drained soil with good organic content to support growth.",
        "Loamy soil types are ideal, providing the necessary drainage and nutrient support.",
        "They thrive in acidic to neutral pH soils, avoiding alkaline conditions.",
        "Compacted or heavy clay soils are not suitable, as they hinder root development."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Prune white firs in late winter or early spring to maintain a strong structure.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.",
        "Be mindful of root disturbances, as white firs have shallow root systems.",
        "Protect young saplings from severe wind with appropriate staking or barriers."
