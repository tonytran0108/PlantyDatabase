    "name": "White Spruce",
    "climate": [
        "White spruce thrives in cold climates and is found in northern regions.",
        "This tree is adapted to harsh winters and cold temperatures, growing best in such conditions.",
        "It prefers regions with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, typical of boreal forests.",
        "In its natural range, it experiences significant seasonal temperature variations."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "White spruce grows best in full sun, requiring direct sunlight for optimal growth.",
        "It can tolerate partial shade but prefers at least six hours of sunlight per day.",
        "Full sunlight encourages dense, healthy growth of the white spruce.",
        "In shaded environments, its growth might be stunted, and it might become sparse."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Regular watering is necessary for newly planted white spruce until established.",
        "Once established, white spruce is drought-tolerant but thrives with consistent moisture.",
        "Over-watering should be avoided, as the tree prefers moist but well-drained soils.",
        "Adequate watering during dry periods is crucial for maintaining healthy growth."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "White spruce prefers moist, well-drained soil with good organic content.",
        "It can grow in a range of soils, from loamy to sandy, as long as drainage is good.",
        "The tree tolerates poor soil conditions but prospers with better soil quality.",
        "Very heavy or clay soils should be avoided to prevent root rot and waterlogging."

    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Regular pruning encourages strong growth and removes dead or diseased branches.",
        "Mulching around the base helps retain soil moisture and control weeds.",
        "Monitoring for pests like the spruce budworm is important to maintain tree health.",
        "Providing windbreaks can protect young trees in very exposed locations."
