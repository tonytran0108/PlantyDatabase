    "climate": ["Wild red raspberries thrive in temperate climates with cool winters.", "They can also grow well in areas with mild summers and adequate rainfall.", "A continental climate with spring and fall seasons is ideal for raspberry growth.", "Avoid hot tropical climates as they can stress the raspberry plants."],
    "sunlight": ["Raspberries require full sun for optimal growth and fruit production.", "At least six to eight hours of direct sunlight are needed each day.", "They can tolerate partial shade, but fruit yield might be reduced.", "Avoid complete shade as it can negatively affect plant health and berry size."],
    "watering": ["Consistent and even watering is essential during the growing season.", "Water deeply once a week, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.", "Raspberries benefit from a stable moisture level to prevent drought stress.", "Improper watering can lead to issues like root rot or reduced berry yield."],
    "soil": ["Raspberries prefer well-draining soil rich in organic matter for growth.", "Slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8 is ideal for these plants.", "Heavy clay soils should be amended with organic matter to improve drainage.", "Raised beds can help provide the appropriate soil conditions for raspberries."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Prune raspberry canes annually to increase air circulation and sunlight exposure.", "Mulching around the base helps retain moisture and suppress weed growth.", "Install support structures like trellises to handle the weight of fruiting canes.", "Regularly monitor for pests like raspberry beetles or aphids and address promptly."]
