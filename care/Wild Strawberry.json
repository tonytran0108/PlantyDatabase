        "The wild strawberry thrives best in temperate climates with cool summers.",
        "They can tolerate cold temperatures, making them suitable for colder regions.",
        "They are adaptable to different climates but prefer regions with moderate rainfall.",
        "Milder climates are ideal as they prefer environments that do not have extreme heat."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Wild Strawberries need at least six hours of sunlight each day for best growth.",
        "They can tolerate partial shade, but less sunlight may reduce fruit yield.",
        "Ideally, these plants should be placed where they get morning sun and afternoon shade.",
        "Too much direct sunlight can lead to scorched leaves and potential plant stress."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Wild strawberries require consistent watering to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.",
        "They prefer slightly moist environments and benefit from regular watering routines.",
        "Overwatering can lead to root rot, so soil drainage is important to consider.",

    "soil": [
        "They thrive in well-drained, loamy soil enriched with organic matter for nutrients.",
        "The ideal soil pH for wild strawberries is slightly acidic, around 5.5 to 6.5.",
