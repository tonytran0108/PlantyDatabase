        "Avoid extremely hot climates as high temperatures can reduce flowering and vitality.",
        "Cool climates with adequate rainfall ensure optimal growth and blooming of winter pansies."
    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Winter pansies prefer full sun but can tolerate partial shade, especially in warmer regions.",
        "Providing at least 6 hours of sunlight a day helps promote vibrant blooming of flowers.",
        "Ensure the plants are placed in a location where they receive morning sunlight for best performance.",
        "Avoid too much shade as it may result in leggy growth and reduced flower production."
    ],
    "watering": [
        "Water winter pansies consistently to keep the soil moist but avoid waterlogging.",
        "In cooler months, they require less frequent watering compared to hot summer months.",
        "Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent root rot caused by excess water retention.",
        "Adjust watering frequency depending on rainfall and evaporation rates in your region."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Winter pansies thrive in well-drained loamy soil enriched with organic matter.",
        "A slightly acidic to neutral pH is ideal, typically ranging from 6.0 to 7.0.",
        "Incorporating compost or aged manure improves soil fertility and moisture retention.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils which may lead to drainage issues and root health problems."

    "extra_care_tip": [
        "Deadheading spent flowers encourages further blooming and improves plant appearance.",
        "Mulch around the base of the plants to conserve soil moisture and protect roots from cold.",
        "Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer every 4 to 6 weeks during the growing season for vigorous growth.",
        "Protect winter pansies from slugs and snails which can damage leaves and flowers."
