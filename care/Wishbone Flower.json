    "climate": ["Wishbone Flowers thrive best in a warm climate, growing well in USDA zones 2 to 11. They are typically grown as annuals.", "These plants appreciate a humidity level of 40-60%, making them ideal for humid climates and comfortable indoors during summer.", "A tropical and subtropical climate is suitable, with temperatures not falling below 60°F (15.5°C).", "Avoid exposing Wishbone Flowers to frost, as the plant cannot survive freezing temperatures. They prefer milder climates."],
    "sunlight": ["Wishbone Flowers prefer partial shade to full shade, requiring protection from the harsh midday sun.", "Ideal for locations receiving morning sunlight and then shade in the afternoon, avoiding intense summer heat.", "While they can tolerate some direct sunlight, too much can cause leaf scorch; hence, filtered light is beneficial.", "In indoor settings, placing them near windows with sheer curtains can help to mimic their preferred light conditions."],
    "watering": ["Keep the soil consistently moist, ensuring not to let it dry out completely between waterings.", "Wishbone Flowers require regular watering, especially during hot and dry periods, to maintain soil moisture.", "Overwatering should be avoided as it may lead to root rot; ensure the pot has drainage.", "Using lukewarm water to maintain soil moisture helps prevent stressing the plant's roots."],
    "soil": ["Wishbone Flowers prefer well-draining soil with a good amount of organic matter to aid in nutrient provision.", "A rich, loamy soil mix can help facilitate proper growth by allowing adequate airflow to the roots.", "Adding peat moss or compost can improve soil quality and drainage needed for healthy plant development.", "Avoid heavy clay soils, which may retain too much water and suffocate the plant's root system."],
