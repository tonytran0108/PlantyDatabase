    ],
    "sunlight": [
        "Woodland Phlox best performs in partial shade, benefiting from some shelter from intense afternoon sun.",
        "This plant prefers dappled sunlight akin to that found under a tree canopy in the wild.",
        "Too much direct sunlight can result in leaf scorch and reduced blooming in Woodland Phlox.",

    ],
    "watering": [
        "Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during the blooming season for best results.",
        "Avoid letting the soil dry out completely, as lack of moisture can lead to wilting and poor growth.",
        "Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the top inch of soil to dry between waterings.",
        "Ensure good drainage to prevent water from sitting around the roots, which can cause rot."
    ],
    "soil": [
        "Woodland Phlox thrives in rich, well-draining soil that retains some moisture yet allows excess to drain.",
        "A soil pH level ranging from slightly acidic to neutral is ideal for optimal nutrient uptake.",
        "Incorporate organic matter such as compost to improve soil fertility and structure.",
        "Avoid heavy clay soils that retain too much water and can cause root issues."
    ],
    "toxic": [
        "Woodland Phlox is generally considered non-toxic to humans and pets."
    ],
    "extra_care_tip": [
        "To promote bushier growth, pinch back the stem tips early in the growing season.",
        "Deadhead spent flowers to encourage longer blooming periods and prevent self-seeding."
