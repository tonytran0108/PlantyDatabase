    "name": "Yellow Pear Tomato",
    "climate": ["Yellow Pear Tomatoes thrive in a warm climate with temperatures ranging from 65°F to 85°F for optimal growth.", "It prefers a growing season that includes long, warm days and plenty of sunlight.", "These tomatoes are sensitive to cold, and frost can damage or kill the plants.", "Humidity levels should be moderate, as high humidity can lead to disease issues in tomatoes."],
    "sunlight": ["Yellow Pear Tomatoes require full sun, meaning they need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.", "Insufficient sunlight can lead to leggy plants and reduced fruit production.", "Plant them in a location where they can receive unobstructed sunlight throughout the day.", "In hot climates, some afternoon shade can prevent the plants from overheating."],
    "watering": ["Consistent and even watering is crucial for Yellow Pear Tomatoes to prevent issues such as blossom end rot.", "The soil should be kept moist but not waterlogged, ensuring adequate drainage.", "Over-watering can lead to root rot and other fungal diseases that can affect the plant.", "Water at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry and reduce the risk of fungal infections."],
    "soil": ["Yellow Pear Tomatoes prefer well-draining, nutrient-rich soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8.", "The soil should be amended with organic matter, such as compost, to provide adequate nutrients.", "Loose, friable soil will allow the roots to expand and absorb nutrients effectively.", "Compacted, dense soil can hinder root growth and reduce the plant's overall vigor."],
    "toxic": [],
    "extra_care_tip": ["Staking or caging Yellow Pear Tomatoes can support their growth and prevent the branches from breaking under the weight of the fruit.", "Regularly prune any suckers that form between the main stem and branches to promote airflow and sunlight penetration.", "Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.", "Timely harvesting when the tomatoes are ripe encourages new fruit production and prevents overripening."]
