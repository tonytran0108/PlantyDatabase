"name": "Black rot (Grape)",
"summary": "Black rot is a fungal disease that affects grapevines, leading to significant crop loss if not controlled. The fungus Guignardia bidwellii causes the disease, manifesting as black lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits.",
"cause_of_disease": [
    {
        "cause": "Fungal infection by Guignardia bidwellii",
        "describe": "The fungus infects grapevine through spores during warm and wet conditions, leading to black spots on leaves and fruits."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Warm, humid weather",
        "describe": "The fungus thrives in warm temperatures and high humidity, which provide ideal conditions for its growth and the spread of spores."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Poor air circulation",
        "describe": "Dense canopy and poor air circulation around vines promote moisture retention, increasing the incidence of the disease."

    {
        "solution": "Application of fungicides",
        "steps": [
            "Select a fungicide approved for black rot in grapes.",
            "Apply in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, starting early in the growing season."

"tips": [
    "Regularly inspect vineyards for early signs of black rot, especially after wet weather.",
    "Implement a regular pruning schedule to maintain vine health and improve air flow.",
    "Consider planting grape varieties that are resistant or less susceptible to black rot where possible."
