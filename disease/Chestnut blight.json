"name": "Chestnut blight",
"summary": "Chestnut blight is a devastating disease of chestnut trees caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. It leads to cankers on the bark, causing the death of branches and eventually the entire tree.",
"cause_of_disease": [
  {
    "cause": "Fungal infection",
    "describe": "The disease is caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, which enters through wounds in the bark and produces toxins that kill the tree's cambium layer."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Airborne spores",
    "describe": "The fungus spreads through airborne ascospores and conidia, infecting nearby trees and exacerbating the spread in groves."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Infected timber and movement",
    "describe": "The disease can spread through the transport of infected wood and timber, which introduces the fungus to new areas."

"tips": [
  "Regularly inspect chestnut trees for signs of infection and prune infected branches.",
  "Promote the growth of resistant chestnut varieties through selective planting.",
  "Practice good sanitation by clearing away and destroying fallen leaves and infected debris around trees."
