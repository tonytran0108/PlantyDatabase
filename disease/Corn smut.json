"name": "Corn smut",
"summary": "Corn smut is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis, commonly affecting corn plants. It results in large, grayish-white galls that can be found on ears, leaves, and tassels, turning black and powdery as they mature.",
"cause_of_disease": [
  {"cause": "Fungal infection", "describe": "Caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis, which infects corn plants and creates galls."},
  {"cause": "Moisture", "describe": "High humidity and wet conditions can promote the spread and severity of the disease."},
  {"cause": "Weak plant tissue", "describe": "Damage or weakness in plant tissue can provide entry points for the fungus, increasing infection risk."}
],
"solution": [
  {"solution": "Genetic resistance", "steps": ["Select and plant corn varieties that show resistance to corn smut.", "Consult with agricultural extension services for resistant varieties."]},
  {"solution": "Crop rotation", "steps": ["Rotate corn with non-host crops to prevent the build-up of the fungus in the soil.", "Implement a multi-year rotation schedule to break the disease cycle."]},
  {"solution": "Field sanitation", "steps": ["Remove and destroy infected plant material to prevent the spread of spores.", "Clean equipment to avoid transferring spores to healthy plants."]}

"tips": [
  "Monitor fields regularly for signs of infection and remove infected plants promptly.",
  "Maintain optimal plant health through proper fertilization and watering to strengthen plant defenses.",
  "Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to infection."
