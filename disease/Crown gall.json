  "name": "Crown gall",
  "summary": "Crown gall is a widespread plant disease caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which induces tumor-like growths, or galls, on the stems, roots, or branches of a wide range of host plants.",
  "cause_of_disease": [
    {
      "cause": "Bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens",
      "describe": "This bacterium enters the plant through wounds and incorporates a piece of its DNA into the host plant’s genome, causing uncontrolled plant cell growth and gall formation."
    },
    {
      "cause": "Wounds on the plant",
      "describe": "Wounds provide a point of entry for the bacteria, which can occur from pruning, grafting, or damage from machinery, animals, or weather."
    },
    {
      "cause": "Contaminated tools or soil",
      "describe": "The bacterium can survive in the soil for long periods and can be spread on contaminated tools, nursery stock, or water."
    }
  ],
  "solution": [
    {
      "solution": "Remove and destroy infected plants",
      "steps": ["Carefully uproot plants showing symptoms of crown gall.", "Dispose of the infected plant material by burning or in another way that ensures destruction of the bacteria."]
    },
    {
      "solution": "Use disease-free planting material",
      "steps": ["Source and plant only certified disease-free seeds and nursery stock.", "Regularly inspect new plants for signs of disease."]
    },
    {
      "solution": "Apply biological control agents",
      "steps": ["Use biological control agents such as the bacterium Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84 as a preventive treatment.", "Apply as a root dip to non-infected plants before planting."]
    }
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Avoid planting susceptible plants in areas known to be contaminated with the bacterium.",
    "Regularly sanitize gardening tools to prevent the spread of the disease.",
    "Improve soil drainage to reduce plant stress and susceptibility to infections."
