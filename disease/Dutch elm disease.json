{
"name": "Dutch elm disease",
"summary": "Dutch elm disease (DED) is a fungal disease that affects elm trees, caused mainly by the fungi Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. It leads to wilting, yellowing, and eventually the death of affected trees.",
"cause_of_disease": [
    {
        "cause": "Fungal infection", 
        "describe": "The disease is caused by the fungi Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, which invade the tree’s vascular system."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Bark beetles", 
        "describe": "Bark beetles, primarily the elm bark beetle, act as vectors for the fungi, spreading the spores from infected trees to healthy ones."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Root grafts",
        "describe": "The disease can spread from one tree to another through interconnected root systems—this is known as transmission through root grafts."
    }
],
"solution": [
    {
        "solution": "Chemical fungicides",
        "steps": ["Use fungicides such as propiconazole to treat infected trees.", "Inject fungicides directly into the tree’s vascular system to control the spread of the disease."]
    },
    {
        "solution": "Removal of infected trees",
        "steps": ["Identify and remove infected trees to prevent the spread of the disease.", "Dispose of the wood properly to eliminate sources of infection."]
    },
    {
        "solution": "Plant resistant varieties",
        "steps": ["Use elm varieties that have been bred for resistance to Dutch elm disease.", "Ensure proper planting locations and conditions to promote healthy growth."]
    }
],
"tips": [
    "Regularly monitor elm trees for signs of disease such as wilting or leaf discoloration to catch infections early.",
    "Implement good sanitation practices by pruning and disposing of dead or infected wood promptly.",
    "Promote the health of trees through proper watering, fertilization, and pest control to increase resistance to infection."
