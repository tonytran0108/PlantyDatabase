"name": "Loose smut",
"summary": "Loose smut is a fungal disease affecting cereal crops, particularly wheat and barley. It is caused by the fungus Ustilago tritici, which infects the plant's seed and grows within the developing grain, eventually replacing it entirely with masses of black spores.",

        "cause": "Fungal pathogen Ustilago tritici",
        "describe": "The disease is caused by the fungus Ustilago tritici, which infects seeds and develops systemically within the growing plant."

    {
        "cause": "Infected seed",
        "describe": "Loose smut is primarily spread through infected seeds, which are asymptomatic until they grow into infected plants displaying symptoms."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Contaminated soil and environmental conditions",
        "describe": "The fungus can persist in the soil and is favored by cool and moist conditions during the flowering stage, facilitating infection."
