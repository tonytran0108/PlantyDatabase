"name": "Phytoplasmas",
"summary": "Phytoplasmas are specialized bacteria that infect plants and are responsible for causing various plant diseases. These pathogens are transmitted by insect vectors, primarily leafhoppers, and affect the plant's vascular tissues, leading to symptoms like yellowing, stunted growth, and abnormal development.",
"cause_of_disease": [
    {
        "cause": "Insect vectors",
        "describe": "Phytoplasmas are primarily spread by sap-sucking insects such as leafhoppers, which transmit the bacteria when feeding on plant sap."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Infected plant material",
        "describe": "Using infected cuttings or grafting with diseased material can spread phytoplasmas to healthy plants."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Root contact",
        "describe": "Phytoplasmas can spread from plant to plant through direct root contact in closely planted crops."

    {
        "solution": "Remove and destroy infected plants",
        "steps": [
            "Identify and remove plants showing symptoms of phytoplasma infection.",
            "Destroy the infected plant material by burning or deep burial to prevent further spread."

        "solution": "Control insect vectors",
        "steps": [
            "Use insecticides to manage populations of leafhopper vectors.",
            "Implement integrated pest management practices to reduce vector presence."

        "solution": "Plant resistant varieties",
        "steps": [
            "Select and plant varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to phytoplasma infection.",
            "Consult local agricultural extensions to identify resistant cultivar options."

"tips": [
    "Monitor crops regularly for early detection of symptoms.",
    "Implement crop rotation and diversify planting to reduce phytoplasma spread.",
