"cause_of_disease": [
    {
        "cause": "Fungal pathogens",
        "describe": "Powdery mildew is caused by several species of fungi, including Erysiphales. These fungi thrive in warm, dry climates and often spread through spores."
    },
    {
        "cause": "High humidity",
        "describe": "Increased humidity levels create an ideal environment for powdery mildew spores to germinate and grow on plant surfaces."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Poor air circulation",
        "describe": "Crowded plantings or dense foliage can limit air flow, encouraging the development and spread of powdery mildew."

    {
        "solution": "Use fungicides",
        "steps": [
            "Apply fungicides specifically designed to combat powdery mildew, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",

        "solution": "Improve air circulation",
        "steps": [
            "Prune overcrowded plant areas to allow more air flow and sunlight penetration.",
            "Space plants adequately during planting to ensure sufficient air movement around them."

    {
        "solution": "Use resistant plant varieties",
        "steps": [
            "Select and plant varieties that are known to be resistant to powdery mildew.",
            "Consult with local nurseries or agricultural extensions for recommendations on resistant varieties."

"tips": [
    "Water plants at the base rather than overhead to minimize humidity on leaves.",
    "Regularly inspect plants for early signs of mildew to ensure timely treatment.",
    "Remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent the spread of the disease."
