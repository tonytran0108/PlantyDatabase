"name": "Wilt of carnation",
"summary": "Wilt of carnation is a common fungal disease affecting carnations (Dianthus species), often caused by soil-borne pathogens, leading to wilting and potentially plant death.",
"cause_of_disease": [
    {
        "cause": "Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi",
        "describe": "This soil-borne fungus invades the plant's vascular system, restricting water and nutrient flow, causing wilting."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Verticillium dahliae",
        "describe": "A fungal pathogen that infects the roots and spreads through the plant's vascular tissue, causing wilting and chlorosis."
    },
    {
        "cause": "Root Rot",
        "describe": "Excessive soil moisture can lead to root rot, weakening the plant and predisposing it to wilt diseases."

        "solution": "Fungicide Application",
        "steps": [
            "Select an appropriate fungicide labeled for controlling Fusarium and Verticillium in carnations.",

        "steps": [
            "Clear the area of plant debris and moisten the soil.",
            "Cover the soil with clear plastic to trap solar heat for 4-6 weeks, reducing pathogen load."

        "steps": [
            "Choose carnation varieties known for resistance to wilt diseases.",
            "Plant in well-drained soil to reduce root stress and wilt incidence."

"tips": [
    "Ensure good soil drainage to prevent root rot and reduce pathogen presence.",
    "Rotate crops and avoid planting carnations in infected soil for several years.",
    "Regularly inspect plants for symptoms of wilt and remove and destroy infected plants promptly."
