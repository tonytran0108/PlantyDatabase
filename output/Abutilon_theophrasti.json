This is mainly due to the fact that it competes for similar nutrients and light needed for the survival of those crops. Each plant can produce between 700 and 44,200 seeds, making the spread of velvetleaf difficult to control.

This is when the plant has germinated but before it has reached the seeding stage. Let's look at the methods for plant control:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: This is a simple and straightforward method. Wear garden gloves to protect your hands. Grasp 'velvetleaf' at its base and pull upward with a firm, steady pressure to remove the entire plant, including the roots. Dispose of the plant in a compost bin or yard waste container.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: This involves covering the area where 'velvetleaf' is growing with a layer of newspaper (at least 10 sheets thick), followed by a layer of mulch like straw or wood chips. This will block sunlight and suffocate the plant, causing it to die back.</li> \n   <li>Using a hoe: Another organic strategy is to use a sharp hoe. Cut 'velvetleaf' at ground level, severing the stem from the roots. Make sure to do this before the plant starts seeding to prevent it from spreading.</li> \n   <li>Organic herbicide: You can create your own using household items. Mix 1 gallon of white vinegar with 1 cup of table salt and 1 tablespoon of dish soap. Using a spray bottle, apply the mixture to 'velvetleaf', focusing on the leaves and stems. This solution should kill the plant within a few days.</li> \n   <li>Crowd it out: Plant densely around 'velvetleaf'. The densely planted area will limit the amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients available to 'velvetleaf', limiting its growth.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
