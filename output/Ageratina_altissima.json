Tremetol is easily passed through cattle that eat the plant, which taints their milk and meat and causes sickness in humans that consume these products.

Using gloves, gently pull the plant, ensuring the entire root is removed to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Place a heavy layer of newspaper or a piece of cardboard over the area where white snakeroot is growing. Top it with a thick layer of organic mulch. This will block sunlight and eventually kill the plant.</li> \n   <li>Organic Herbicides: Use vinegar, which is a natural weed killer. Ensure to spray it directly on the plant, avoiding desirable plants around it.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
