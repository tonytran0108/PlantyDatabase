No tools are needed, just a pair of gardening gloves to protect your hands.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Lay cardboard or any non-see through material over the area covered by garlic mustard. Keep the material in place for an entire growing season to suffocate the plant.</li> \n   <li>Plant competition: Planting native ground cover plants in the area can help outcompete garlic mustard for resources.</li> \n   <li>Biological control: Certain insects such as the Garlic Mustard Root Weevils can be introduced into the area. They feed specifically on the seeds of garlic mustard thereby limiting its spread.</li> \n   <li>Solarizing: Cover the area with a clear plastic sheet during the hottest months of the year. The heat trapped under the plastic will kill garlic mustard by baking the soil.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
