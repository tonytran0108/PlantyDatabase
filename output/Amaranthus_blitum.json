This species is considered a weed in Europe, Asia, and Africa (Nigeria and Mozambique, specifically). It has a negative impact on farms in Japan and Brazil and is considered one of the chief recurring weeds in crops there. It can outcompete commercial crops such as mulberries, cassava, pineapples, maize, and others. _Common_Name_ also has been reported as poisonous to livestock because of its high nitrate content. The weed can also outcompete native plants in grasslands and islands. In Africa, Central and North America, Asia, and the South Pacific Islands, it is eaten as a minor crop.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Doing so will drastically limit its ability to re-emerge the following year. Here are a few methods of removal:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: Wearing a pair of gardening gloves, grip the main stem near the soil surface and slowly pull the plant up, roots and all, which will prevent it from growing back.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: In a sunny area, cover the ground with a clear plastic sheet after watering it thoroughly. The heat from the sun will kill the weed seedlings that are trying to sprout. Do it for several weeks to ensure its effectiveness.</li> \n   <li>Organic Herbicides: Use vinegar as a natural herbicide, apply it directly onto the leaves of the weed, ensuring not to get it on your desired plants. This method is suitable for small infestations.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Mulch the area with compost or straw to prevent light from reaching the soil surface, inhibiting the weed's growth.</li> \n   <li>Introduce a Ground Cover: Choosing a fast-growing, robust ground cover can smother the weed, blocking the light and therefore preventing the weed from growing.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
