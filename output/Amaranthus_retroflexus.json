In the United States, it is a weed from Texas to North Carolina. In total, it is considered an invasive weed in 58 countries such as France, Belgium, Russia, Germany, and Portugal. The plant prefers to root in disturbed non-wetland areas. This species hosts pests that damage important crops such as maize, cotton, and sorghum. The redroot amaranth is highly poisonous to grazing animals and humans due to the nitrates that it pulls up from the soil.<span class=\"articleComment\" comment=\"71474\">&nbsp;It can be controlled through herbicides, cultivation, or by introducing beetles such as the pigweed flea beetle.&nbsp;</span>\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Here are the details on various organic methods you can use to prevent and control this plant:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: This is a simple yet effective way to control redroot amaranth. Make sure to yank out the entire plant, including its taproot, while the soil is moist to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Tillage: Use a hoe or a rototiller to agitate the soil and uproot redroot amaranth plants. Make sure to remove the uprooted plants and dispose of them properly to prevent seed dispersion.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Spread a thick layer of organic material like straw or leaf compost in your garden. This smothers redroot amaranth seedlings by depriving them of sunlight, slowing their growth or eliminating them altogether.</li> \n   <li>Biocontrol: Introduce natural enemies of redroot amaranth such as certain insects or grazing animals. For example, releasing leaf-feeding beetles can help regulate redroot amaranth population.</li> \n   <li>Crop rotation: Rotate your crops each season to break the lifecycle of redroot amaranth. This reduces the chances of redroot amaranth re-infestation.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
