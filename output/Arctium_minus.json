Interestingly, this trait of lesser burdock has directly inspired the invention of Velcro. It is a hardy plant that thrives in fields and on disturbed land.

Try to get as much of the root as possible to prevent the plant from regrowing.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the lesser burdock with a heavy layer of mulch, aged compost, or landscape fabric. Leave it covered for a few months to completely block the sunlight and prevent photosynthesis, which will eventually kill the plant.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: Wet the area infested with lesser burdock then cover it with a clear plastic sheet. Secure the edges with rocks or soil. Leave it like this throughout the hottest part of summer. The sun will heat the covered soil, killing the plant effectively.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
