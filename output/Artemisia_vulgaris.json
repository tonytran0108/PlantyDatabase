It is undesirable in agricultural fields, along railways and roadsides. It is also listed as a common or troublesome agricultural weed in the US states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.\n  </div> \n  <div>\n   Common mugwort is difficult to control because it spreads efficiently underground via rhizomes, plus it is a generally hardy plant. These traits make it capable of taking over large areas if not controlled. Another reason it is considered a weed is that it causes dermatological toxicity in some susceptible individuals. In warmer regions, it can also spread via seeds.\n  </div> \n  <div>\n   Controlling common mugwort manually can be a time-consuming task, but it is still doable. Removing the plants constantly by hand or machine will eventually exhaust the entire plant, including the underground stems.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Here are some methods of removal and control:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: This is the most basic, straightforward method. You simply need to uproot the weed, trying your best to remove all its roots to prevent it from regrowing.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: A sharp garden hoe is used to cut the weed off at its base, just below the soil surface. This method is useful when the soil is dry, and may need repeating now and then as the plant starts to grow again.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: This involves covering the ground where common mugwort is growing, with thick layers of mulch or newspaper. This denies the plant sunlight and air, stats it needs for photosynthesis, and it eventually dies and decomposes.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This involves sunny weather. First, you'll need to mow or trim the common mugwort to ground level, then cover that area with a clear plastic tarp. The sun's rays will heat up the soil underneath the tarp, killing common mugwort and other unwanted plants.</li> \n   <li>Organic herbicide: This involves the use of naturally derived herbicides like vinegar or clove oil which cause damage to plant leaves. Just fill a spray bottle with the herbicide and apply on the plant's leaves, ensuring not to damage other wanted plants around. Reapply if necessary until the plant withers and dies.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
