It is naturalized in cultivated fields and dry grasslands in some parts of southern and Central Europe.\n  </div> \n  <div>\n   Because it can't compete against well-established native vegetation, the invasive spread of common milkweed depends on land disruption, making it a seriously troublesome agricultural weed of grain crops, soy, and corn. Also, it is toxic to sheep and cattle, making it undesirable in pasturelands. Still, it should not be forgotten that common milkweed is the only feeder plant of Monarch butterfly caterpillars. The invention of herbicides and a wide campaign against common milkweed has directly contributed to the population crash of the iconic American butterfly.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",
