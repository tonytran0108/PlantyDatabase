It can now be found all across the world, having been cultivated for its delicate, trumpet-like flowers. However, it has proven to be quite the pest, being difficult to manage with its deep roots, copious rhizomes, and aggressive spreading. Elimination is nearly impossible and with hedge bindweed's quick growth along the ground, it has become problematic for crops. Its seeds and roots are also slightly poisonous. Continuous removal of roots over several seasons is one of the few ways of controlling this weed.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

As soon as you can identify the plant, begin control measures. Here are some organic or interesting methods for controlling hedge bindweed:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: This method requires you to physically pull out the plant from its roots. Target young plants or those in sandy soil where roots are easier to remove. Always wear gloves and ensure to remove as much root as possible. Persistence is key because root fragments left behind might sprout new plants.</li> \n   <li>Mowing or Cutting: Regularly cut back the plant before it has a chance to flower and produce seeds. This can weaken the plant over time. Remember, this method is more effective when combined with other strategies as hedge bindweed can re-grow from remaining roots.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the infested area with a thick layer of landscape fabric, old carpets, or heavy-duty garbage bags to block sunlight. Secure the covering with rocks or bricks and leave it in place for at least two growing seasons to choke off the plant.</li> \n   <li>Biocontrol: Introduce plant's natural enemies, like insects, that feed on hedge bindweed in its native habitat. Be cautious, as these methods require careful management to avoid harm to non-target species.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: Use a strong domestic vinegar or horticultural vinegar (with higher acetic acid concentration) as a spray on the leaves. This method can burn the plant's foliage but may need to be repeated multiple times to be effective, especially on older, established plants.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
