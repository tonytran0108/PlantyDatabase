Be sure to get the entire root system to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: If oriental bittersweet has taken over a large area, cover the invaded area with a thick layer of mulch or a tarp. This method is slow but effective. The plants will be deprived of light and eventually die.</li> \n   <li>Vine Cutting: Cut the vines of oriental bittersweet at the base and again a few feet up, removing a section of vine in between. This can help prevent the vines from re-rooting and continue to grow.</li> \n   <li>Biological Control: Some insects and fungi which are native to the same region as oriental bittersweet are known to feed on it. The introduction of these into the garden can help to control oriental bittersweet. It's a natural way of controlling this plant but needs to be managed carefully to prevent imbalance in the ecosystem.</li> \n   <li>Regular Monitoring: Keep a regular check on your garden. If oriental bittersweet is spotted early, taking immediate action can prevent it from taking over.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
