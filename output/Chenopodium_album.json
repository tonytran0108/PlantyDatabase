Remember to wear gardening gloves to protect your hands.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: Use a hoe to chop off the plants at the ground level. Do it early in the morning on a sunny day so that the sunlight will dry out the severed weeds.</li> \n   <li>Covering: This method involves placing a layer of newspapers, cardboard, or a weed barrier over the garden area. This will block the sunlight and kill the weeds.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Organic mulch like straw or grass clippings can prevent weed seeds from germinating. Apply around 2-3 inches of mulch evenly around your plants.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar spray: Mix a cup of vinegar with a cup of water. Spray it on the weed leaves on a sunny day. Vinegar acts as a natural herbicide but be careful not to overspray it on your desirable plants.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
