Common chicory isn't considered strictly invasive, but it does freely self-sow, enabling it to take over a lawn or garden. Though it does produce flowers, the blooms only last a short amount of time before leaving behind unattractive stems and scraggly leaves. Common chicory is also problematic for farmers, as it spreads prolifically in pastures and croplands. To keep from spreading, hand removal of the entire taproot is the most efficient. Herbicides typically only kill the top of the plant, but it can simply regrow from the root.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",
