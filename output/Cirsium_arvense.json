Ensure to remove as much root as possible to prevent re-growth.</li> \n   <li>Tilling: A mechanical method under which soil is turned over using a plow or rototiller. This is done to bury the existing plants and to sever the root system, making it difficult for the plant to grow again.</li> \n   <li>Use of organic herbicides: Apply vinegar or citric acid onto the thistles. These acidic substances penetrate the plant's cuticle damaging it and causing dehydration. This is best done on hot sunny days for optimal efficiency.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
