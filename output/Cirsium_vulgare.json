It is considered an invasive weed in many regions such as Africa, North America, Australia, and parts of Europe. Bull thistle grows in sunny disturbed areas. The weed takes available light and resources within the soil, eliminating other native plants in its invaded habitat. It can cause contact dermatitis and often obscures visibility or access to invaded areas. The weed is unpalatable to animals and can crowd out native vegetation that would otherwise provide nutrition for grazing animals. Bull thistle can be removed by cutting the weed before it seeds but can also spread via wind. Despite its drawbacks, Bull Thistle is a commercial crop in Australia.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",
