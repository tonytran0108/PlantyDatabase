Its accelerated development during these seasons leads to a swift increase in height and denser leaf production. Interestingly, the plant's rapid growth also stimulates the vibrant red coloration in its stems, contributing to its striking appearance. While red osier dogwood's growth slows in other seasons, the momentum gained in its active growing periods culminates in hardy winter resilience.",
