Its highly invasive nature and resistance to herbicides has earned it the name the \"Devil's Grass.\" This weed has been recorded as an invasive weed in over ninety-six countries including the United States, Belgium, Australia, and South Africa. The grass can have negative effects on asthmatics. In sugarcane, cotton, maize, and other staple crops, it is known to reduce yields. It also hosts a great number of crop pests and diseases, leading to further losses in crop yields. However, this weed helps to reduce erosion. It has also been used in religious worship. When necessary, bermuda grass can be treated with herbicide or mechanical removal.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",
