Do so while the soil is wet as it makes the process easier.</li> \n   <li>Mowing: Regularly mow the garden to prevent orchard grass from setting seed, thereby controlling its spread.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Using organic mulch blocks light and prevents orchard grass from growing. Apply a thick layer of mulch around the plants and replenish it periodically.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This process involves covering the soil with clear plastic to trap the sun's heat, which kills orchard grass. First, moisten the area, then cover it with clear plastic and leave it for 4-6 weeks during a hot period.</li> \n   <li>Biologic control: Some gardeners use geese as they are excellent grazers of orchard grass. These birds can be an eco-friendly solution, but they should be monitored to make sure they don't harm other plants in the garden.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
