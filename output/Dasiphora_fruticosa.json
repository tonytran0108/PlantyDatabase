    "attributes": "With a slow growth speed, shrubby cinquefoil primarily expands during Spring and Summer. This gradual growth rate results in a structured and even arrangement of leaves, enhancing its resilience against resource depletion, diseases and pests. It may also entail a meticulous increase in height, producing steady, compact growth. Noticeable flowering accrues often late in the active season, flourishing distinctly against the dense foliage. Horticulturalists appreciate shrubby cinquefoil's modest requirements and the aesthetic value it provides through slow, enduring growth patterns.",
