The grass is found around the world and cultivated in Germany and Poland for animal feed. The edible seeds are what make the grass a problem. The seeds germinate in the spring and continue until the fall. It is a quick-spreading weed that will choke out native plants and grasses in a short time. It is easier to control in cultivated gardens and harder to remove from lawns. Thinner, cool weather grasses can easily succumb to hairy crabgrass. Once established, it is hard to completely remove from the area.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

        "howFixWeed": "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <div>\n   The best season to remove 'hairy crabgrass' is late spring or early summer. This is before the plant has had chance to flower and set seed. Here are some methods:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: This basic, yet effective method involves physical removal of the 'hairy crabgrass' plant using your hand. This method is best for smaller infestations. Ensure you have proper gloves on, then grasp the plant at its base and pull gently to remove the entirety of the plant, roots included. Dispose of the plants in a green waste bin.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: This method uses an opaque material to cover the area where the 'hairy crabgrass' is growing. The material prevents sunlight from reaching the weed, thus hindering its growth. Place a sheet of cardboard or dark plastic over the infected area, securing it well. Leave it for a few weeks allowing it to effectively kill the weed.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: An eco-friendly method is using a homemade vinegar weed killer. Add a cup of table salt to a gallon of vinegar. Pour this solution into a spray bottle and target the 'hairy crabgrass' directly. This method can easily damage other plants, so it should be used carefully. Spray on a sunny day for the best results.</li> \n   <li>Using Corn Gluten Meal: This method not only helps in removing 'hairy crabgrass' but also prevents it from growing back. Sprinkle a generous amount of corn gluten meal over the affected area, then water it lightly. The corn gluten creates a barrier that prevents 'hairy crabgrass' seeds from germinating.</li> \n   <li>Encouraging Healthy Lawn: Maintaining a healthy lawn is a natural deterrent for 'hairy crabgrass' as it prevents it from propagating. Regularly water and feed your lawn, and maintain a lawn height of about 2.5-3 inches. This will make it harder for the 'hairy crabgrass' to compete.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
