It possesses a unique ability to reproduce via seeds and spreads aggressively, making it difficult for other species to grow. Similarly, in gardens, this property of fringed willowherb proves detrimental as it tends to take over space rapidly and deprives native vegetation of necessary nutrients, sunlight, and water. It poses a threat to the garden's biodiversity. Its primary mode of spread is through its tiny, lightweight seeds which are numerous and can be easily carried away by wind or water currents. Notably, each plant is capable of producing up to several thousand seeds. It is this characteristic that enables fringed willowherb to invade and colonize new areas so rapidly, wreaking havoc on the local ecosystem and proving particularly problematic in gardens.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

It is most effective to remove the plant during this time, ideally before it gets a chance to start flowering.\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Manual Weeding: Pull the fringed willowherb by hand when the soil is moist. This ensures that you eradicate all portions of the root system.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area where fringed willowherb grow with a thick layer of mulch or a weed-suppressing landscape fabric. This method blocks sunlight from reaching the plants, preventing their growth.</li> \n   <li>Lawn Mowing: Regularly mow your lawn to prevent the fringed willowherb from flowering and seeding. Make sure to bag and dispose of clippings so seeds do not spread around your lawn.</li> \n   <li>Corn Gluten Meal: Apply corn gluten meal in the early spring. This organic compound prevents weed germination, thereby controlling the spread of fringed willowherb.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: Spray a homemade vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 1 part water) on the fringed willowherb. Only use this method in areas where you do not wish for other plants to grow as the vinegar is non-selective and will harm other plants.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
