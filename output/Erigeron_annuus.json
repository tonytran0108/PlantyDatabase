The plant is recognizable by its daisy-like clumps of flowers and sudden appearance in gardens. Its unsightly leaves and crooked stems exude the appearance of a weed, which can greatly detract from the look of an ornamental garden. Annual fleabane is also an aggressive spreader due to its high re-seeding rate and ability to self-pollinate. The plant directly competes with other plants in the vicinity, causing problems for native species and vegetable beds alike. Manually pulling for a couple of years will wear away the root system and lead to elimination.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Use your hands to physically pull out the plant from the ground, making sure you remove the entire root system to prevent it from regrowing. Dispose of the plant in your green waste bin.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: Using a garden hoe, dig around the base of annual fleabane to loosen the soil. Once the soil is loose, pull the plant and its root system out. Make sure to hoe regularly to keep the plant from returning.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Shred organic material like leaves, wood chips, or straw and distribute it around the area where annual fleabane is growing. The mulch should be 2-3 inches thick to effectively block sunlight and suppress the growth of the plant.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This is a longer method taking a full season but effective for large infestations. Wet the soil and cover it with a clear plastic tarp during the hottest part of the year. The sun will heat the soil under the plastic, killing the plant and its seeds.</li> \n   <li>Planting Competitive Species: Choose plants that are local to your area and known to grow well. Plant these in the same area as annual fleabane to naturally compete for resources and space, discouraging the growth of annual fleabane.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
