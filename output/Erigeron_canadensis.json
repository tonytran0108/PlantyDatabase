Following are some methods to remove or control this plant:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Handpulling: Put on a pair of gardening gloves and gently pull the horseweed from the soil. Ensure you remove the entire root system to prevent it from regrowing.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: Use a garden hoe to cut the plant at its roots. Aim to do this before the horseweed produces flowers to prevent seed dispersal.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area around the horseweed with a thick layer of organic mulch like compost or straw. This blocks sunlight, stifering the plant's photosynthesis.</li> \n   <li>Solarizing: Water the area around the horseweed thoroughly and cover it with a clear plastic sheet. The intensified heat from the sun will cook and kill the plant.</li> \n   <li>Using Cover Crops: Plant a cover crop that quickly outcompetes the horseweed for nutrients and sunlight.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
