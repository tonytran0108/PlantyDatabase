When compared with the common plants in the Euphorbia genus, its flowers seem petty compared to the other plants. Therefore, it is called the petty spurge."

It typically grows in gardens and agricultural fields. It is on AlaskaÃ¢ÂÂs invasive species list and in the U.S. Invasive Plant Atlas. Use gloves to remove due to the plantÃ¢ÂÂs sap, pulling straight up to remove the roots, or use an herbicide. The plantÃ¢ÂÂs sap can cause contact dermatitis and severe eye pain and is toxic if ingested. It is also called cancer weed because its sap is being studied for potential skin cancer treatments.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

The plant should ideally be removed before it starts to flower and set seeds, usually before late summer to fall.\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: This method involves physically removing petty spurge from the soil. Ensure you grab the plant from the base, near the root system, and pull upwards with a firm, steady pressure. This method is best done when the soil is moist, as it makes the plant easier to uproot completely.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This is a process that uses the sun's energy to kill petty spurge. First, irrigate the area where the plant grows, then cover it with a clear plastic tarp. Leave the tarp in place for at least 4 to 6 weeks during the hottest part of summer. The heat trapped beneath the tarp will effectively kill the plant.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: This method involves covering petty spurge with a mat, tarp, or even old carpet, denying the plant access to sunlight and effectively starving it. The cover should be left in place for a full growing season to ensure the complete death of the plant.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar spray: In a spray bottle, mix equal portions of water and white vinegar. Spray this mixture directly onto the petty spurge on a hot sunny day. The acidity of the vinegar will help to kill the plant, while the hot sun will amplify the effects.</li> \n   <li>Planting Cover Crops: Plant a cover crop that can outcompete petty spurge for resources. This method requires that you plant the cover crop as soon as petty spurge is removed, depriving it of the opportunity to repopulate the area.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
