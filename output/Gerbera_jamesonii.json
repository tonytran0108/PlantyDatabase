People are impacted by seeing their vibrant color and brightness, infected by its diffusion of happiness, liveliness, and open-mindedness. Gerberas also have the symbolism of prosperity. Gerberas are great flowers for giving to others, and can also be used on many different occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the small country of Madagascar in Southern Africa, where tropical flowers and plants were abundant, there lived a young girl named Sloaney. She liked the little African chrysanthemum flower, with its slightly curved stems and drooping flowers. When she got married, she requested to add something to the ambience of the wedding hall. During the wedding, friends and relatives from all sides sang, danced and toasted one another. But little did anyone know that the groom, who usually drank very little, would be drunk already after three rounds of drinking. He hunched over and leaned from side to side, so the bride brought him to the bedroom to rest. When people saw this, they were reminded of the very similar shape of the wild flowers. Many girls said in unison, \"Oh, the flowers are like Fulang!\" From then on, the name \"Fulang flower\" spread. It is because of such legends that the African chrysanthemum has become an important decorative flower for couples to include in their wedding celebrations. They represent the mutual respect and love of the newlyweds, and declare well-wishes for the couple.",
