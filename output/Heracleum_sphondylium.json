But the plant's large leaves aren't the only reason it's considered invasive: its large seeds can spread easily in the fall, producing new plants in the spring. A spreading root system also leaches nutrients from the ground that native plants need to survive.

Be sure to remove the entire root to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Mowing: Regular mowing can help suppress cow parsnip. Mow as low as possible without damaging desirable plants. Make sure to mow before the plant has a chance to seed to prevent further spread.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area with a thick layer of mulch, cardboard, or a tarp to block sunlight and smother cow parsnip. Leave the cover in place for at least one growing season to ensure the plant is dead.</li> \n   <li>Grazing: Some types of livestock, such as goats, enjoy eating cow parsnip and can help control its growth. Monitor the livestock to ensure they're not overgrazing the area and damaging other plants.</li> \n   <li>Planting Competitive Species: Plant species that can compete with cow parsnip for resources.
