It has spread to parts of the Americas, Oceania, and southern Africa and is listed as noxious in areas of the United States and Canada. It is cultivated in farms and gardens for several uses. However, common St. John's wort is toxic to some livestock, depletes soil moisture, competes with native species, and may increase the risk of fire. It spreads voraciously as individual plants can produce up to 100,000 seeds annually, seeds can remain viable for up to 10 years, and plants can also spread laterally through rhizomes. Hand pulling, tilling, mowing, and burning are typically not effective means of control and may even stimulate reproduction.

Ideally, the plant should be removed before it matures and starts to flower or fruit to avoid propagation. Here are a few effective ways to control the spread of common St. John's wort:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: Start by thoroughly watering the area around the plant. Wait for the soil to loosen up, then gently pull out the plant, making sure you remove the entire root system.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Once you've pulled common St. John's wort from its ground, immediately cover the area with a layer of heavy-duty garden fabric or plastic sheeting. This should help prevent any remaining seeds from sprouting.</li> \n   <li>Hot Water: If common St. John's wort has overrun a large patch of land, consider this method. Boil some water and carefully pour it over the plant. The hot water will kill it and make it easier to remove.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Cover the soil around common St. John's wort with a thick layer of mulch. This will block sunlight and make it difficult for the plant to photosynthesize and grow.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: Fill up a spray bottle with a mixture of vinegar and a little detergent. Spray the solution directly onto common St. John's wort. The acetic acid in the vinegar will cause the plant to wilt and die.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
