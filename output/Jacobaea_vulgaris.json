ItÃ¢ÂÂs considered a weed due to its aggressive and invasive nature. Tansy ragwort thrives even under adverse conditions, multiplying rapidly and often outcompeting other plant species for resources such as space, water, and nutrients. What truly sets it apart as a harmful weed, though, is that it is toxic to many animals especially horses and cows. When ingested, it can cause severe liver damage which can often be fatal. The main mode of spreading is through its small, lightweight seeds which are easily carried by the wind, enabling the plant to colonize new areas quickly. Its capacity to produce thousands of seeds from a single plant significantly contributes to its rapid spread as well. Consequently, tansy ragwort can quickly overrun a garden, causing damage and pushing out preferred plants.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Best done after rain when the soil is moist, making it easier to pull out roots.</li> \n   <li>Mowing: Regularly mow the area where tansy ragwort is growing, before it has the chance to flower and release seeds. This procedure interrupts the plant's lifecycle.</li> \n   <li>Biological control: Introduce insects that feed on tansy ragwort, such as the Cinnabar moth or Ragwort flea beetle. They can damage the leaves and stems, reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Cover the area with a thick layer of mulch. This blocks sunlight preventing tansy ragwort from photosynthesizing and adding nutrients to the soil.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: A process by which you can control tansy ragwort with heat. Cover the area with a clear plastic tarp during the hottest part of summer. The sunlight warms up the soil and eliminates the weed.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
