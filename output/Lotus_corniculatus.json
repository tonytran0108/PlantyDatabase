It is recorded as an invasive weed in fourteen countries including the United States of America, Australia, South Africa, and Norway. It has been identified as a problematic weed in the American states of Minnesota, Washington, and New York. The common bird's-foot trefoil forms dense mats that prohibit shade and choke out native vegetation. However, it can also be used to fight roadside soil erosion and to improve pastures because it promotes nitrogen restoration in the soil.
