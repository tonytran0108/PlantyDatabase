It grows well in small pots placed on the balcony, windowsill, hallway, stairs and other areas around the house. It can also be shaped into a ball, or put into a hanging pot, which is quite chic and exotic. Mandevilla plants not only beautify the indoors, but also bring lots of fragrance to the room.",
