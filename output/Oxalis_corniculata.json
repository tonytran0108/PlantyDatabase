It is capable of self-pollinating and produces massive amounts of seeds in short timeframes. This growth affects crops, gardens, and greenhouses across the world. As the plant can grow year-round in greenhouses, creeping woodsorrel poses a particular problem for these growers. Removal is extremely difficult due to the high level of seeds. Hand-weeding and covering seeds with mulch are the simplest means of controlling the spread. Following up pulling with an herbicide is the best way to eliminate the plant completely.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Then handle the plant at its base and gently pull up to uproot the whole plant. Make sure every piece of the root is removed to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: This method requires a piece of cardboard or several layers of newspaper. Cover the creeping woodsorrel with the material and secure it with stones or other heavy objects. This blocks sunlight and air, ultimately killing the plant.</li> \n   <li>Organic Herbicides: Use organic herbicides like vinegar or citric acid, which you can dilute with water. Spray this solution directly onto the creeping woodsorrel in the morning when the sunlight can enhance the effects.</li> \n   <li>Landscape Fabric: Spread a piece of landscape fabric over the area of creeping woodsorrel and tuck it into the topsoil. The fabric acts as a barrier, preventing the plant from receiving sunlight, thus inhibiting its growth.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
