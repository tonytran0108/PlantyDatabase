While not considered strictly invasive, Oxalis dillenii is quite a pain to contain and is considered a weed in most countries. The taproots are tough, and colonies arise from the widespread root system. Slender yellow woodsorrel is problematic in lawns and gardens as it can completely take over any unoccupied space and is nearly impossible to completely eradicate. Hand pulling is the most effective means of removal, as the plant cannot re-sprout from damaged roots. Herbicides are typically not very effective.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Here are some organic and interesting methods to control or remove slender yellow woodsorrel:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: Dig up the whole plant with its roots using a gardening tool. Be sure to remove as any tiny root fragments can potentially regrow. Dispose of the plants properly to prevent them from re-rooting.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area with newspaper or cardboard, making sure no sunlight reaches the soil below. This will suffocate the plants and prevent them from growing.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: Combine equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray it directly on the plant, specifically on warm, sunny days for the best results. The acetic acid will cause it to dry out and die.</li> \n   <li>Constant Mowing: Regularly mow or cut the plant close to the ground before it has a chance to seed. This gradually weakens the plant over time and restricts its growth.</li> \n   <li>Plant Competition: Plant dense, competitive species in the area to outcompete slender yellow woodsorrel. The more robust plants will absorb nutrients and block sunlight, limiting the resources available for slender yellow woodsorrel to grow.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
