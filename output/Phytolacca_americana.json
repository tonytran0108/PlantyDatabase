Here are some methods for organic removal or control of this plant:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: On spotting pokeweed in your garden, wear gloves and pull it out directly from the ground by firmly holding the plant at its base. The best time for pulling out is after a rainfall, when the soil is loose, enhancing the chances of extracting the full root system, hence decreasing its chances of regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: To prevent pokeweed from getting sunlight and eventually killing it, cover the plant entirely with a thick layer of mulch or a tarp. This method may take some time but is highly effective in weed control.</li> \n   <li>Using a Weed Torch: This is an interesting yet effective method. You can use a weed torch to apply quick bursts of heat to pokeweed's foliage and stems without setting the plant on fire. This will cause the plant cells to burst, leading to the plant's death.</li> \n   <li>Mowing: Since pokeweed is a perennial plant and relies on seeds for propagation, regularly mowing the area can prevent the seeds from maturing and falling to the ground.</li> \n   <li>Digging Out: Using a shovel, you can dig out the entire plant. Make sure to dig around the main root to ensure no roots are left, as this can encourage regrowth.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
