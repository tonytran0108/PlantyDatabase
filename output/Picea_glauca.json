The limited growth speed results in incremental height gain and leaf production, displaying a seasonal rhythm of calculated development. Interestingly, despite its slow-growing nature, white spruce maintains resilience to environmental stressors, symbolizing quintessential adaptation. However, a milder growth speed is observed in other seasons compared to summer.",
