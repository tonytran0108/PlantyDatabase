It is extremely widespread and can be found on nearly every continent. Though small in size, it is quick to colonize, and its seeds easily germinate, making the plant an oppressive neighbor to native species. Ribwort plantain has also proven to be problematic for home gardens and various crops, including citrus and mango, as it can become the home of multitudes of diseases and insects. The pollen of ribwort plantain is allergenic. Ingestion could lead to chest congestion, sneezing, watery eyes, and occupational asthma. Herbicides are the most effective means of removal.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

This is because the sort of cooler, moist conditions in these seasons tend to make it easier to take out the plant's roots. However, you should aim to remove this plant before it gets to the seeding stage, which usually happens in late spring or early summer. Now, let's discuss some methods for removal or control:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: Start by soaking the ground around the ribwort plantain to loosen the soil. Then, dig around the base of the plant with a small garden trowel or hand fork, making sure you get as much of the root system as possible to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the ribwort plantain with a thick layer of newspaper or cardboard, topped with mulch. This blocks light and smothers the plant, causing it to die over time.</li> \n   <li>Using a weed whacker: Cut the ribwort plantain down to ground level repeatedly. Depriving the plant of its ability to photosynthesize will eventually kill it, although this method may take several rounds to be effective.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This involves covering the area with clear plastic during the hot summer months. The greenhouse effect caused by the plastic will heat the soil and kill the ribwort plantain.</li> \n   <li>Organic herbicides: There are organic herbicides on the market that can kill ribwort plantain. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the label for best results.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
