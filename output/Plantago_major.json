It typically grows in grasslands and pastures and is highly resistant to trampling and cutting, making it a threat to nearby croplands. Being a dense turfgrass, the common plantain can quickly crowd out other plants and disrupt landscaping. It is notably difficult to remove and colonizes any compact space it can find.
