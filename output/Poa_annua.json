It is considered a nuisance within its native range and invasive outside of it. This large range is partially due to high phenotypic plasticity, which allows annual bluegrass to adapt more readily to a variety of habitats. Additionally, each plant can produce thousands of seeds annually that can be spread by livestock, birds, wind, water, and clothes/boots. While a variety of herbicides have been shown to be effective in controlling annual bluegrass, some populations have evolved resistances. Thus, a rotation of different herbicides can be more effective. Alternatively, hand pulling can be effective at controlling small infestations, while mulching can also help suppress weed development.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Do not mow too short, as this can weaken the desired grasses and give annual bluegrass an advantage.</li> \n   <li>Boiling water: Pour boiling water over annual bluegrass to kill the plant without the use of chemicals. Please exercise caution to avoid damage to surrounding plants.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar spray: Mix a solution of vinegar, water, and a drop of dish soap to spray directly onto annual bluegrass, which will help to kill it Ã¢ÂÂ this is best used in areas where you donÃ¢ÂÂt want any plants to grow, as it can harm other vegetation.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
