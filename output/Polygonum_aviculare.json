It is considered invasive or an agricultural weed in 3 states. It readily establishes a persistent seedbank, with individual plants able to produce thousands of seeds that can last several years. Prostrate knotweed has been used as groundcover and cultivated as a dye; it has also been found to suppress other weeds and kill potato pathogens. However, it can also have synergistic effects or acts as an alternative host for crop pathogens and pests. Mowing is generally ineffective due to its matting growth pattern, but a combination of herbicide and other techniques including tilling, polarization, undersowing, and plowing can effectively control prostrate knotweed.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

It's ideal to remove this plant before it reaches the flowering stage to prevent it from spreading seeds.\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: Put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands. Grasp the knotweed close to the ground and firmly pull it out, being careful to remove all the roots. Doing it after rainfall can make this task easier as wet soil loosens the root grip. Dispose of the plant in a garden waste bag.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area where prostrate knotweed is growing with a thick layer of newspaper or cardboard, and then add a layer of mulch on top. This method works by denying the plant light and air, causing it to die off.</li> \n   <li>Planting competition: Simultaneously planting faster-growing, more competitive plants can help limit the space for prostrate knotweed to grow. Choose species that are native to your area and that grow thickly to limit the knotweed's access to light, water, and space.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
