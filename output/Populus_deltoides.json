As temperatures rise, it swiftly produces an array of large, shade-casting leaves, concurrent with a remarkable height increase, often reaching up to 6 feet annually. This accelerated growth supports the plant's strategy to out-compete neighboring vegetation for sunlight. However, variation in growth rate is observed, with speed tapering off when reaching maturity or during colder months.",
