Mock strawberry spreads with the help of wildlife, its rapidly growing runners, and creating a network of sprouts, many of which are difficult to spot. It also grows year-round, making removal strenuous. The plant can take over forest floors and choke out native forage species if left unchecked. It can also cover entire lawns as a groundcover when allowed to spread as it thrives in moist environments. Manually pulling entire roots early in the season is the best way of controlling the spread of mock strawberry.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

At this time, the plant is in its peak growth phase but has not yet started bearing fruit. Therefore, eradicating it before development of fruit can prevent it from further spreading. Here are some organic and interesting methods which you can adopt to control or remove this plant:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: You simply need to grip the plant as close to the ground as possible and gently but firmly pull it out. Make sure you get the entire root system, as leaving fragments behind can allow the plant to grow back.</li> \n   <li>Cultivation: Dig into the soil with a hoe or a shovel disrupting the plant's roots. Be careful not to chop up the plants too much as small pieces can lead to new plants.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the mock strawberry plants with a thick layer of newspapers or cardboard, then pile several inches of mulch on top. This blocks sunlight and effectively smother and kill the plants, without the use of any chemicals.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: A technique that consists of covering the soil where the mock strawberry is growing with a clear plastic tarp during the hottest part of the year. The heat from the sun is trapped under the tarp, raising the soil temperature enough to kill the weed seeds and roots.</li> \n   <li>Planting Competitors: Plant species that are more aggressive or that can out-compete mock strawberry. They'll limit the weed's ability to spread by taking up space and resources it would otherwise use.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
