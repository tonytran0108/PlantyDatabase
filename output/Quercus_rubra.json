The treeÃ¢ÂÂs moderate speed of growth allows it to allocate energy efficiently, ensuring robust growth and development. This growth rhythm manifests through the gradual thickening of its trunk, steady expansion of foliage, and incremental increases in overall height. This scale of growth is in stark contrast to faster-growing species, distinguishing Quercus rubraÃ¢ÂÂs unique adaptability to a range of environmental conditions.",

It is almost as if its red leaves are behaving like the warm sun, illuminating people's hearts and bringing warmth to its surrounding. Also, its bark is red like its leaves and it gets darker as it ages. To distinguish them from Quercus falcata, which is also known as the southern red oak, the tree is called the Northern red oak."
