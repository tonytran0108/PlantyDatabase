Its non-native range includes the British Isles, North America, temperate South America, New Zealand, and temperate Australia. Curly dock can grow in a wide variety of habitats and is commonly found in roadsides, car parks, railway beds, forest edges, shorelines, fields, and wastelands. It's easily spread, which is why it causes concern. Its main way of spreading is through its lightweight seeds which can float on water, get stuck in fur and clothing, and by contaminating crop seeds. In many places, including the UK and the states of Arkansas and Iowa in the US, it is officially classified as a noxious or 'injurious' weed.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

You need to grasp the weed at its base, close to the ground, and then pull it out, taking care to remove the entire root system.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This is an effective means of controlling the weed. It involves covering the area with a clear plastic sheet during the hot summer months. This will trap the sun's heat, killing the weed as well as the seeds in the soil.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: This method involves covering the soil with a thick layer of organic matter. This will help prevent the weed seeds from germinating. You need to apply the mulch in a thick layer, at least 2 inches deep, to block sunlight and suppress weed growth.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
