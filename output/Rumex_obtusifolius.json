A cause for concern is that the weed thrives in a range of different temperature zones: temperate regions and even the Arctic Circle! Bitter dock is a very hardy plant with high seed production. The seeds can remain viable for a long time. Also, the plant has a strong branching taproot that can produce new shoots after the upper part of the plant has been cut down. It is found mostly in grasslands but spreads primarily through soil-disturbing agricultural or maintenance practices.\n  </div> \n  <div>\n   Bitter dock is considered an invasive weed both within and outside its native range. It is listed as an agricultural, environmental, and garden weed in The Global Compendium of Weeds. It is also considered to be one of the most troublesome weeds in intensively managed pastures throughout its range because it reduces grass yields and food intake by grazing animals.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Make sure to remove all roots to prevent regrowth.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the area with a thick layer of organic mulch or a landscaping fabric. This deprives the plant of sunlight, ultimately killing it.</li> \n   <li>Using a weed torch: Carefully apply heat to bitter dock to cause it to wilt and die. Be aware of safety measures when using this method.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: Regularly cutting bitter dock at the base with a sharp hoe can weaken the plant, making it easier to pull out.</li> \n   <li>Using corn gluten meal: Apply this natural pre-emergent herbicide early in the spring to prevent bitter dock seeds from developing.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
