This disturbs the roots, preventing the plant from taking in nutrients and water, causing it to perish.</li> \n   <li>Sheet Mulching: Lay down a thick layer of newspaper or cardboard over the area where the american black nightshade is growing. Wet the material to help it stay in place, and then cover it with a thick layer of organic mulch. This blocks sunlight and smothers the plants underneath, causing them to die.</li> \n   <li>Hand Pulling: This is a simple and effective way to get rid of small populations of american black nightshade. Ensure you pull out the entire root system to prevent regrowth. Be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar spray: In a spray bottle, mix equal parts of water and white vinegar. Spray the vinegar solution liberally onto the american black nightshade. Be careful not to spray nearby plants you wish to keep as vinegar is non-selective and can harm them.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: Cover the area infested with american black nightshade with a clear plastic tarp during the hottest part of summer. The sunÃ¢ÂÂs rays will heat the soil and kill the plants.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
