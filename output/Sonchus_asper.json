Use gardening gloves to get a firm grip on the stem of spiny sowthistle and pull directly upward to remove the entire plant, taking care to remove the deep roots.</li> \n   <li>Hoeing: When the soil is dry, use a sharp hoe to cut the plant at ground level. This method can restrict the plant's ability to photosynthesize which will eventually lead to its death.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Use a thick layer of organic material or a specifically designed weed mat to cover the spiny sowthistle making sure no sunlight can get through. This will starve the plant of light, restricting its growth and ultimately killing it.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This technique uses the power of sunlight to kill spiny sowthistle. Clear the area of all vegetation then water it thoroughly before covering with a clear plastic sheet. Leave the sheet in place for at least 4 to 6 weeks during the hottest part of the year, sunlight will heat the soil and kill the weeds.</li> \n   <li>Vinegar Spray: Create a homemade weed killer by combining vinegar with a small amount of dish soap. Spray it directly onto the spiny sowthistle, and the acetic acid in the vinegar will kill the plant.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
