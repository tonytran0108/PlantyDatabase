It spreads aggressively due to its small light seeds, which are easily dispersed. One plant can produce up to 6,000 seeds, making it an ecological threat to native plants. It particularly threatens crops with its dense growth and quick flowering. Common sowthistle also dramatically reduces water resources and is known to host 23 different species of pests, which only adds to its weedy invasion.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

This minimizes the chance of reinfestation in the following seasons.\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand pulling: This involves taking hold of the weed at its base and pulling it out from the ground. Ensure you remove the whole root to prevent the plant from growing back.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Lay down a thick layer of organic mulch (like compost, wood chips, or straw) around your plants. This helps prevent common sowthistle seeds from getting the sunlight they need to grow.</li> \n   <li>Solarizing: This method requires a clear plastic sheet. Spread it over the infested area during the warmest part of the year. The heat trapped underneath the plastic will kill common sowthistle.</li> \n   <li>Biological control: There are certain insects and pathogens that feed on common sowthistle and can naturally control its spread. Research the local organisms that are safe to introduce into your garden.</li> \n   <li>Planting dense ground covers: Establishing competitive plants can help keep common sowthistle from taking hold by denying them the space and resources to grow.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
