These seeds germinate extremely fast, and even when they don't, they can remain viable in the soil for up to 60 years. Sprouts create dense shoots that outgrow native species and can quickly take over ecosystems.

        "howFixWeed": "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <div>\n   The best season to remove common chickweed is spring, before its flower buds fully open to prevent the weed from reseeding. Here are a few ways you can control or remove it:\n  </div> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Hand-pulling: Water the area lightly to loosen the soil then begin pulling the weed from the base to ensure you remove the whole plant. It's best to do this when the soils are moist for easier extraction.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Lay down thick black plastic sheeting or layers of newspaper over the area where the weed has grown. This prevents light from reaching the weed, eventually killing it. This process may take several weeks.</li> \n   <li>Solarization: This method involves covering the weed-infested soil with a clear plastic tarp during the hottest months of the year. The sun heats the soil underneath to temperatures that kill the weeds. Leave the tarp in place for at least six weeks.</li> \n   <li>Using Corn Gluten Meal: Scatter corn gluten meal over the area to prevent the weed seeds from germinating. Apply in early spring before the weed begins its growth cycle. The corn gluten meal is harmless to mature plants and beneficial soil organisms.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Lay organic mulch like straw, shredded bark, or leaf compost around your other plants to suppress common chickweed growth. The mulch blocks sunlight and makes it difficult for the weed to grow.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
