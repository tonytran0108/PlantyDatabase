This plant is considered a weed due to its extremely aggressive growth pattern and capability to take over large areas. Its ability to multiply rapidly stems from its prolific seed production and underground rhizomes, which enable it to spread swiftly. Common tansy is harmful because it contains substances that deter beneficial insects, disrupt the balance of soil nutrients, and can even pose health risks to humans and animals if consumed in large amounts. If you grow common tansy in your garden, you should look out for its dense, button-like, yellow flowers and finely-divided, fern-like leaves. The primary means of its dispersion is seed wind dispersion, but it also spreads through the creeping of its rhizomes.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

This should be done before the flowers develop.</li> \n   <li>Mowing: Repeatedly cut down common tansy close to the ground. This will weaken the plants and may prevent them from flowering and seeding, reducing their spread.</li> \n   <li>Mulching: Cover the ground with a thick layer of organic mulch to suppress the growth of common tansy. Ensure the mulch is several inches deep to effectively block sunlight and prevent the plants from emerging.</li> \n   <li>Cultivation control: If cultivating common tansy, encircle the bed with a physical barrier, such as buried garden edging, to restrict its horizontal root movement and contain its growth within a designated area.</li> \n   <li>Companion planting: Plant competitive species that can outgrow common tansy and reduce its spread, such as tall perennials that can overshadow and thereby inhibit its growth by limiting available sunlight.</li> \n  </ol> \n </body>\n</html>"
