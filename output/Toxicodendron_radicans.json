What's more, poison ivy is infamous for the highly unpleasant itchy rash (dermatitis) it causes upon contact due to the presence of urushiol, an irritating oil present in the plantÃ¢ÂÂs sap. When poison ivy spreads, uninvited, into a garden, there is an increased risk that humans will come into accidental contact with the plant, so it's a good idea to remove it. To remove the weed, it is possible to use herbicides, but care should be taken to avoid skin contact.\n  </div> \n </body>\n</html>",

Be sure to dig deeply enough to remove all roots, as 'poison ivy' can grow back from even small root pieces.</li> \n   <li>Smothering: Cover the poison ivy area with thick plastic or a tarp to block sunlight and starve the plant. Leave the cover in place for at least a year to ensure all plant parts have died.</li> \n   <li>Organic Herbicides: You can use vinegar-based or citrus oil-based organic herbicides.
